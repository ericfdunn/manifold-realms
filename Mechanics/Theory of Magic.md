# Schools of Magic

Magic is divided by domain instead of by caster type. The casting stat could be any mental stat. 

- Abjuration (Wis) : heightened by one level for each plane above material

- Conjuration (Wis): Material is temporary created by binding elemental forces. You can summon or banish creatures to adjacent planes, but planar travel is only possible at nodes and you can only move to corresponding locations one plane up or down. 

- Divination (Int) : normal for current plane and one below, - 2 beyond that

- Enchantment (Cha) 

- Evocation (Cha) 

- Illusion (Int) 

- Necromancy moved to illusion or elsewhere

- Transmutation (Int) heightened by one level for each plane below material

Here are some possible analogies between the schools of magic in D&D and mathematical fields or techniques:

1.  Abjuration: Set theory. Abjuration spells are all about protecting or separating things from each other, just as set theory deals with defining and manipulating sets of objects and their relationships.
2.  Conjuration: Topology. Conjuration spells involve creating objects or summoning creatures from other planes, much like topology studies the properties of spaces and surfaces and how they can be transformed.
3.  Divination: Statistics. Divination spells allow characters to gather information and predict the future, much like statistics involves analyzing data and making predictions based on probability.
4.  Enchantment: Game theory. Enchantment spells are all about influencing the decisions and actions of others, just as game theory studies the strategic interactions between individuals and groups.
5.  Evocation: Calculus. Evocation spells involve manipulating energy and matter, much like calculus deals with rates of change and the accumulation of infinitesimal units.
6.  Illusion: Geometry. Illusion spells create images and illusions that trick the senses and distort perception, much like geometry studies the properties of space and shape.
7.  Necromancy: Combinatorics. Necromancy spells involve manipulating life and death, much like combinatorics studies the arrangements and combinations of discrete objects.
8.  Transmutation: Algebra. Transmutation spells involve changing the form or properties of objects, much like algebra deals with manipulating and transforming equations and variables.

1.  Abjuration - Topology, which studies the properties of space that are preserved under continuous deformations, such as stretching or bending. Similarly, abjuration spells often manipulate the space around the caster to create protective barriers or wards.
2.  Conjuration - Particle physics, which explores the fundamental building blocks of matter and their interactions. Conjuration spells often involve summoning or manipulating matter and energy, much like particle physics investigates the behavior of particles and their interactions.
3.  Divination - Quantum mechanics, which describes the behavior of particles at a very small scale and the probabilistic nature of their interactions. Divination spells often involve perceiving and manipulating information, similar to how quantum mechanics involves understanding and manipulating probabilities at a fundamental level.
4.  Enchantment - Chaos theory, which studies the behavior of systems that are highly sensitive to initial conditions and exhibit complex, unpredictable behavior over time. Enchantment spells often manipulate the thoughts and emotions of creatures, influencing their behavior in unpredictable ways.
5.  Evocation - Special relativity, which describes the behavior of objects moving at high speeds or in strong gravitational fields. Evocation spells often manipulate energy and matter in powerful, explosive ways, much like the behavior of particles in extreme physical conditions.
6.  Illusion - General relativity, which describes the behavior of objects and energy in the presence of strong gravitational fields. Illusion spells often manipulate perception and reality, creating convincing illusions that alter the way creatures perceive their environment.
7.  Transmutation - Symmetry, which describes the ways in which objects and systems remain unchanged under certain transformations or operations. Transmutation spells often involve altering the physical properties of matter, much like how symmetries can be used to describe the behavior of particles and fields.

numerology/arithmancy

Abjuration

Conjuration: Geometry or group theory/symmetry

Divination: Statistics, astrology

Enchantment: Game theory, 

Evocation: Chaos Theory, Catalysis, Manipulation of Dark Energy (quintessence)?

Illusion: Fractals, Optics
The Polish mathematician Benoit Mandelbrot is often credited as the "father of fractals" for his pioneering work on fractal geometry in the 1970s. Other mathematicians who made significant contributions to the field include Georg Cantor, Gaston Julia, and Felix Hausdorff.

Transmutation: Topology, Alchemy


## Spells
Haste - takes you to the upper edge of your plane and grants you the effects of extra time. You may detected by those in the plane above you. 

Shadow spells - take you to the lower edge of your plane. You're invisible, but slowed and may be detected by those on the plane below you

## Wizard Factions
- Geometers (geometry/geomancy): uses shapes and drawings to channel magical power. Especially adept at creating permanent magic through alignment of buildings or markers. 
- Numerists (arithmetic/numerancy): focuses on the special properties of numbers, the mystical conjunctions of primes, and transcendentals, etc. Their calculations can be written out into enormous tables of numbers or tallies of arcane figures, or even woven into patterns. Their rivalry with the Geometers centers on the purity of their abstraction into numbers versus the reliance on pictures and drawings. 
- Bards (Musicology): Study the how the patterns of the universe are reflected in music. Compute the harmonic and aharmonic chords and the melodic progressions of scales that attune to and even manipulate the world around them.
- Druids/[Shugenja](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shugend%C5%8D)/[Apkallu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apkallu) / Yakshas. Evolution, Pharmacology?


## Dark Matter

Dark matter is a type of matter thought to account for approximately 85% of the matter in the universe and about a quarter of its total massâ€“energy density or about 2.241 x 10^-27 kg/m^3. It's called "dark" because it does not appear to interact with the electromagnetic field, which means it does not absorb, reflect, or emit electromagnetic radiation, and is therefore difficult to detect.

If Earth suddenly had more dark matter nearby, it might not directly impact life on Earth or the planet's structure itself in any perceptible way, primarily because dark matter interacts very weakly with ordinary matter. It does not interact electromagnetically, which means it doesn't experience friction or collide in the traditional sense. This is one of the reasons it's so hard to detect and why we don't notice the dark matter that is already passing through the Earth.

However, the presence of additional dark matter could have other, more indirect effects. For example, dark matter is believed to play a crucial role in structure formation in the universe. Its gravitational effects cause it to act as a kind of "scaffolding" on which ordinary matter arranges itself. If there were suddenly more dark matter in our vicinity, it might affect the orbits of objects in our Solar System or even nearby star systems over a very long time period, due to its additional gravitational influence.

In terms of research and science, having more dark matter nearby might make it easier for scientists to detect and study, providing a significant boon to our understanding of this elusive substance.

Again, this is all speculative. The properties and behavior of dark matter are still subjects of ongoing scientific investigation as of my knowledge cutoff in September 2021.

## Dark Energy

According to Einstein's theory of General Relativity, the presence of mass (or energy) warps the fabric of spacetime. This warping effect leads to the phenomenon known as time dilation, where time appears to pass slower in a stronger gravitational field compared to a weaker one. This has been experimentally confirmed with precise atomic clocks on Earth and in space.

Dark matter, though it does not interact with electromagnetic forces, does contribute to the total mass-energy content of the universe, and hence it also warps spacetime. If there was a significant increase in the amount of dark matter in our vicinity, it could, in theory, increase the degree of this warping effect and thus impact the rate at which time passes.

However, it's important to note a couple of things:

1. Dark matter is thought to be distributed fairly evenly on large scales, and it's not clear how it could suddenly increase in a localized area such as near Earth.

2. Even if it did, the effect on the passage of time would likely be extremely small, given the weak gravitational influence of dark matter.

3. The hypothetical increase would have to be extremely large - much larger than any plausible natural variation - to have a noticeable effect.

4. This is all quite speculative and based on current knowledge and understanding of dark matter and general relativity, which may change with future discoveries.

In summary, while an increase in local dark matter could, in principle, affect the passage of time, any such effect would likely be very small and would require an implausibly large increase in dark matter.
