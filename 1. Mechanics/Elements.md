# The Elements

The seven elements embody the animating forces of the world and the philosophical balance between thelm. All natural, living, and magical forces are composed of one or more of the elements. There are six primary elements forming three pairs of opposites, and the final element, #void, which exists outside of the elements and binds them together.  Scholars of the elements identify the patterns of the natural transformation of the elements and practicioners of the magical arts take advantage of these relationships to enhance the effects of their spells.

## Relationships of the Elements

### Opposition Pairs
The primary elements come in three pairs of opposites. When opposing elements meet they tend to diminish or cancel eachother our. As philosophical opposites, they cannot exist in the same place and time or they form a contradiction.

- **Earth/Air:** Where Earth is stable and consistent, Air is changeable and seeks freedom.
- **Water/Fire:**  Where Fire is about expending energy outward, Water is about conserving and gathering energy inward. Fire’s passion leads to action and change in the external world, while Water’s emotion leads to internal reflection and understanding.
- **Wood/Metal:** Where Wood is about organic growth and creation, Metal is about structure, order, and intellectual rigor.

## Color Confinement

Individual #elements do not occur in isolation, they are always bound in groups of two or three by the #void element. There are two ways elements may come in existence:

1. **An opposing pair forming nonliving matter**
	An element comes into existence with its opposite and can never be fully separate from it or it will cease to exist. An element's opposite is not an ideological or physical opponent, but more a fact of existence.
2. **A triplet of three different colors forming a living being**
	Living beings are more than simple matter, they are a synthesis of many different energies to have a life force and karma. The three colors combine to form the white, animating light of life. If any of the colors was missing, the being would die or become a ghost. The color of an element can vary, allowing a living being to be composed of any three non-opposing elements (8 combinations). 


| Combination |  |  |
|---------|-----------|------------|
| Earth, Water, Fire |  |  |
| Earth, Water, Wood |  |  |
| Earth, Metal, Fire |  |  |
| Earth, Metal, Wood |  |  |
| Air, Water, Fire |  |  |
| Air, Water, Wood |  |  |
| Air, Metal, Fire |  |  |
| Air, Metal, Wood |  |  |

> [!Info] Behind the Scenes
> The elements of Sevenfold are based on a combination of Platonic, Buddhist, and Chinese elemental theory. 
> The Tripartate Soul takes its name from Plato's theory, but the mechanics come from Color Confinement, a property of Quantum Chromodynamics which necessitates that a baryon is composed of three quarks of differnet "color". In here quarks are represented by the three pairs of elements (six total) plus a seventh (void) to represent the gluon.


Inspiration Sources: Wu Xing, The Chinese Five Elements
- **Interconnectedness and Balance:** Wu Xing emphasizes the connections between all things. The generation (生, shēng) and control (克, kè) cycles show how the elements support and regulate each other, maintaining balance in the natural world. Reflecting these cycles in your game can highlight the interdependence of the elements.
    
- **Dynamic Change:** Unlike the static concept of elements in Western traditions, Wu Xing is all about transformation and change. Each element is not just a substance but a phase of change, moving to the next in a dynamic cycle of evolution and influence.
    
- **Characteristics and Associations:** The five elements in Wu Xing are associated with a wide array of characteristics, from emotions to seasons, directions, colors, and senses. Integrating these associations into your elements can provide depth and cultural context.
    
- **Philosophical and Practical Applications:** Wu Xing is not just theoretical; it's applied in Chinese medicine, feng shui, martial arts, and even cooking. Your game could mirror this by allowing the elements to be applied in various skills and practices within the world.
    
- **Moral and Ethical Dimensions:** Wu Xing includes a moral dimension, where the elements are associated with virtues and human behavior. This could be reflected in your game by aligning character actions and consequences with the balance of the elements.
