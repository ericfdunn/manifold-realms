# Theory of Magic
## Magic in the Manifold Realms
Magic can take many forms, from innate qualities to studied forms, a simple thought to an elaborate ritual. What all magic has in common is the manipulation of the magic septessence that exists in every living and nonliving thing, although it is not distributed evenly. Manipulation of Septessence always produces some vibration, this can be audible like a spoken word or tone, a felt vibration, a mental tingle, or even the crumbling of an expended material. The act of casting of a magic spell or ability varies depending on the caster, but is likewise accompanied by a spoken incantation, a music chord, a banging drum, or crushing of material component. The casting of a spell could be obvious or subtle, and the effect can always be discerned by one learned in the Arts (via Arcana check or spell like Detect Magic). 

Magic can be naturally acquired (ie sorcerers), mastered through study (ie wizards), or gifted (ie Warlocks, Clerics). 
## Septessence
 Septessence (name subject to change) is what those that study the Arts know mediates all magical effects. The concentration of Septessence in the lower planes is what gives them properties different form the upper planes.  Septessence grants fantastic powers to those who can wield it, but it also distorts spacetime - meaning that time can be slowed and distances contracted - and the effect increases with the amount of Septessence.
- casting powerful spells takes more time because the concentration of Septessence literally slows down time around the caster.
- drawing too much magic can cause a crushing pain from the contraction of coma from the loss of time

### Spell Effects
- Dispel magic/Haste/Time stop: The caster ends magical effects by dispersing Septessence. At high enough power, the area of effect becomes a bubble in time, allowing those inside to act while everything around is still. The other side effect is that to those inside the bubble the space around them would appear to recede away from them, making it hard to see outside. Of course, spells can't be cast inside the bubble because of the lack of Septessence. 
- Clairvoyance/scrying: the caster concentrates spacetime to bring a certain point in the distance closer to their vision. The caster experiences their vision rapidly approaching them until the target comes into focus. The further the target, the longer it takes to cast spell, and extreme distances or locations on other planes would also experience a noticeable time dilation effect. If you attempt to scry a location on a higher plane or far away, you will see time passing very quickly at the destination. It will be hard to see details and it maybe hard to get timely information at all. Scrying a lower realm has the benefit of the time gradient working in your favor, making it considerably more effective to scry on a lower realm since your target will be moving slower allowing you to take in more details.

Haste - takes you to the upper edge of your plane and grants you the effects of extra time. You may detected by those in the plane above you. 

Shadow spells - take you to the lower edge of your plane. You're invisible, but slowed and may be detected by those on the plane below you

## Magic and the Planes
-  what effect does the differening magic concentration have?
	- slower/faster recovery of magic
	- empowered effects?

## Wizard Factions
- Geometers (geometry/geomancy): uses shapes and drawings to channel magical power. Especially adept at creating permanent magic through alignment of buildings or markers. 
- Numerists (arithmetic/numerancy): focuses on the special properties of numbers, the mystical conjunctions of primes, and transcendentals, etc. Their calculations can be written out into enormous tables of numbers or tallies of arcane figures, or even woven into patterns. Their rivalry with the Geometers centers on the purity of their abstraction into numbers versus the reliance on pictures and drawings. 
- Bards (Musicology): Study the how the patterns of the universe are reflected in music. Compute the harmonic and aharmonic chords and the melodic progressions of scales that attune to and even manipulate the world around them.

> [!Info] Behind the Scenes
> **Dark Energy as Septessence**
> 
> According to Einstein's theory of General Relativity, the presence of mass (or energy) warps the fabric of spacetime. This warping effect leads to the phenomenon known as time dilation, where time appears to pass slower in a stronger gravitational field compared to a weaker one. This has been experimentally confirmed with precise atomic clocks on Earth and in space.
> 
> Dark matter, though it does not interact with electromagnetic forces, does contribute to the total mass-energy content of the universe, and hence it also warps spacetime. If there was a significant increase in the amount of dark matter in our vicinity, it could, in theory, increase the degree of this warping effect and thus impact the rate at which time passes.
>
> **Dark Matter**
>
>Dark matter is a type of matter thought to account for approximately 85% of the matter in the universe and about a quarter of its total mass–energy density or about 2.241 x 10^-27 kg/m^3. It's called "dark" because it does not appear to interact with the electromagnetic field, which means it does not absorb, reflect, or emit electromagnetic radiation, and is therefore difficult to detect.
>
>If Earth suddenly had more dark matter nearby, it might not directly impact life on Earth or the planet's structure itself in any perceptible way, primarily because dark matter interacts very weakly with ordinary matter. It does not interact electromagnetically, which means it doesn't experience friction or collide in the traditional sense. This is one of the reasons it's so hard to detect and why we don't notice the dark matter that is already passing through the Earth.
>
>However, the presence of additional dark matter could have other, more indirect effects. For example, dark matter is believed to play a crucial role in structure formation in the universe. Its gravitational effects cause it to act as a kind of "scaffolding" on which ordinary matter arranges itself. If there were suddenly more dark matter in our vicinity, it might affect the orbits of objects in our Solar System or even nearby star systems over a very long time period, due to its additional gravitational influence.

## Patrons and Gods

- Characters can form a pact with a powerful being or god in exchange for power
- Gods are beings whose disposition aligns so strongly with an ideal or domain that they become synonymous with that ideal. Alternatively, some gods are formed as personifications of strongly held ideals.
- Patrons gain an intuitive sense regarding any of their pact holders and a bonus for any divination spell they use on them. Characters have a sense of their patron's strongly held beliefs and can make an insight check to intuit their patron's preferences towards a given circumstance.
- Rituals can be performed to increase the connection
- Transgressions can void the pact or oath until an atonement is performed
- The patron's awareness of the character's actions may depend on the terms of the pact. In some cases, patrons might use familiars or intermediaries to keep tabs on their warlocks.

## Binding
While a true "living" being has three different colored elements. A single element is just one color, and so is not "material" until bound to some form. This binding requires conjuration magic. Mortals can bind an elemental to almost any form of matter temporarily (as in a summoning spell) or to another creature, which lasts until the creature dies or is dispelled.
The Aelph were a creation of powerful magic, binding their elemental force permanently to a form constructed of the material of Aelfrice, a form modeled and named after the race of High Elves. However, the Aelph are still not completely real and will appear ghostly and weak in the light of the sun.

- **Violation of Elemental Sentience:**
    
    - In a world where elements might have sentience or consciousness (like spirits of water, earth, etc.), spells that enslave, manipulate, or torture these entities would be unethical.
    - Harmful effects include binding elemental spirits against their will, using them as mere tools, or disrupting their natural purpose.
### Summoning Spells
During generic creature #summoning, some matter must be present for the elemental to be called forth and bound. This could be earth, leaves, or sticks that take the form of an animal for a Conjure Animals spell. Once the material is animated, the creature becomes indistinguishable from a real creature of that type unless closely inspected. 
On the other hand, a summoned elemental is a pure expression of that element and takes form from the pure skill and exertion of the spellcaster, not requiring any specific matter to be present.
To summon a creature with intelligence, the specific individual must be known and named. They must be on an adjacent plane and not somehow warded against translocation. The creature may make a Charisma save to resist the summoning, and circumstances may impose an advantage or disadvantage on that check.

Elementals can be "drawn out" of an existing creature by applying energy until it's soul fragments (as in [hadronization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hadronization))
## Combination Casting
- **Elemental Combos:**
    
    - Players can combine their elemental spells to create more powerful effects. For example, a fire spell and an air spell could create a blazing whirlwind.
    - Balance this by requiring precise timing or synchronization checks (like simultaneous skill checks) to successfully combine spells.
- **Ritual Casting:**
    
    - For large-scale or particularly powerful spells, implement ritual casting that requires multiple casters. Each participant contributes a part of the spell, like a verse of an incantation or a component of a ritual.
    - Balance this by making such rituals time-consuming and requiring detailed preparation, making them impractical in combat but useful for significant non-combat challenges.
- **Shared Mana Pool:**
    
    - Players can opt to share a mana pool when casting spells cooperatively. This pool is larger than individual mana pools but depletes as any participant casts a spell.
    - Balance by having the shared mana pool recover more slowly than individual pools, reflecting the strain of maintaining the shared magical link.
- **Elemental Harmony Mechanic:**
    
    - Spells cast in succession by different players that harmonize (e.g., water followed by wood) could be more effective or have additional effects.
    - Balance by introducing the risk of disharmony when incompatible elements are used in succession, which could reduce the effectiveness of spells or have unintended consequences.
- **Amplification and Modulation:**
    
    - One player can cast a spell while another amplifies or modulates it. For example, one player casts a fireball, and another uses air magic to guide and accelerate it.
    - Implement limitations on how often or how much a spell can be amplified to prevent overpowering.
- **Casting Chains:**
    
    - Create a system where spells cast in a specific sequence by different players result in a chain reaction, leading to a cumulative effect.
    - Balance by requiring each player to successfully perform their part of the chain, with the risk that one failure could break the chain.

## Natural Magic/Place Magic
### Exploitation Benefits:

1. **Enhanced Power or Abilities:**
    
    - Spells that disrupt nature or elemental balance are more potent. For example, a fire spell that causes a wildfire might be more destructive in the short term.
    - Mechanic: Grant bonus damage, larger area of effect, or additional spell effects for such actions.
2. **Resource Gain:**
    
    - Exploiting nature might grant valuable resources quickly, like rare minerals from aggressive earth exploitation or magical energy from draining a ley line.
    - Mechanic: Provide materials or magical boosts that are otherwise hard to get or require time-consuming quests.
3. **Shortcut to Objectives:**
    
    - Unethical actions could provide shortcuts to complex problems. For example, corrupting a water elemental to flood an area might quickly clear a path that otherwise requires extensive exploration.
    - Mechanic: Allow significant progress in quests or objectives with a single powerful action.

### Exploitation Costs:

1. **Environmental Backlash:**
    
    - The exploited area suffers visible damage: dying flora and fauna, extreme weather, etc. This can affect entire regions, altering the game world.
    - Mechanic: Introduce negative environmental modifiers that affect all characters in the area, like reduced healing, hazardous terrain, or aggressive wildlife.
2. **Social and Moral Consequences:**
    
    - NPCs react negatively to environmental destruction: villages suffer, trade routes close, and characters might be shunned or attacked.
    - Mechanic: Alter NPC attitudes, increase prices, or deny services; introduce bounty hunters or environmental guardians as new adversaries.
3. **Elemental Imbalance:**
    
    - Overuse of one element weakens its counterpart. Excessive fire spells might weaken water-related magic in the area, affecting all magic users.
    - Mechanic: Implement a system where elemental magic potency is tied to environmental balance, visibly affecting spell effectiveness.
4. **Personal Corruption:**
    
    - Continuous exploitation leads to physical or mental corruption: changes in appearance, unsettling dreams, or whispers tempting further dark acts.
    - Mechanic: Introduce a corruption meter; as it rises, trigger negative effects like vulnerability to certain attacks, social penalties, or loss of control over actions.
5. **Restoration Quests:**
    
    - To repair the damage, players must undertake specific quests, like healing the land, appeasing angry elementals, or purifying corrupted areas.
    - Mechanic: Offer redemption paths that require effort and resources, but gradually restore balance and remove negative effects.

### Balancing the System:

- **Transparency:** Clearly communicate the potential consequences of actions. Players should understand the trade-offs they are making.
- **Player Choice:** Allow players to make informed decisions. Provide alternatives to exploitation, even if they are more challenging.
- **Dynamic World:** Let the world react dynamically to player choices, reinforcing the impact of their actions.
- **Redemption and Recovery:** Offer paths to restore balance, allowing players to correct their mistakes and learn from them.

## Limitaions of Magic and Technology

### Interacting with Magic Devices
1. **Elemental Compatibility:** Introduce a system where characters must use their understanding of elemental magic to interact with devices. For instance, a device might require channeling specific elemental energies in a certain sequence to activate, or it might respond differently to different elemental influences.
    
2. **Arcane Language and Symbols:** Implement a system of arcane symbols or languages that characters must learn and interpret to operate magical devices. This can involve puzzle-solving elements where players decode inscriptions or runes to understand how to use the device.
    
3. **Magical Blueprint Reading:** Similar to engineering blueprints, magical devices could have their own schematics that characters need to study and understand. This could involve a mini-game or a series of skill checks related to arcane knowledge, investigation, or even history.
    
4. **Energy Source Management:** Make the power source of the device a key element of its operation. Characters might need to replenish, redirect, or balance the energy flow within the device, using their knowledge of magic and elemental forces.
    
5. **Feedback Mechanism:** Devices could give feedback based on the characters' actions, leading to a learning process. For instance, a device could emit different colors, sounds, or vibrations in response to actions, guiding the player towards the correct operation method.
    
6. **Combination of Skills:** Require a combination of skills for successful interaction. For example, a character might need to use Arcana to understand the magical aspect, Investigation to find hidden compartments or mechanisms, and Sleight of Hand to manipulate small, intricate parts.
    
7. **Magical Crafting and Repair:** Introduce elements of crafting where characters can modify or repair magical devices. This could involve collecting rare materials, understanding the device's original design, and using specialized tools.
    
8. **Rituals and Incantations:** Some devices might require performing specific rituals or reciting incantations, which could involve multiple steps and conditions to fulfill, such as performing the ritual at a certain time or aligning the device in a specific manner.
    
9. **Lore and History Knowledge:** Knowledge of the device's background or the culture that created it could be crucial. This can encourage players to engage more with the world's lore and history.
    
10. **Cooperative Problem-Solving:** Some devices could require multiple characters to operate, each performing different tasks simultaneously or in sequence, encouraging teamwork and strategic planning.

### Powered Magical Devices
1. **Living Energy Sources:** Instead of batteries, magical devices could be powered by 'living' energy sources. This could be anything from bound elemental spirits to enchanted creatures, or even plants that have been imbued with magical properties. Interacting with these sources would require knowledge of magical lore, negotiation with the spirit, or care and cultivation of the plant.
    
2. **Ritualistic Activation and Maintenance:** Operating magical devices could require specific rituals. These rituals might need to be performed periodically to 'recharge' the device. This makes the process more personal and ritualistic, as opposed to the impersonal nature of simply swapping batteries.
    
3. **Personal Energy Investment:** Instead of a detachable battery, devices could require a direct infusion of the user's magical energy. This creates a more intimate connection between the user and the device and could have interesting implications for risk/reward gameplay. Overuse could weaken the user, but the device's effectiveness might be proportional to their strength and skill.
    
4. **Sympathetic Resonance:** Devices could operate on the principle of sympathetic magic. They require items or substances that resonate with the device's purpose. For instance, a device designed for communication might require a piece of an object that belonged to the intended recipient of the message.
    
5. **Inscribed Runes and Sigils:** Replace wires and circuits with inscribed runes or sigils that channel magical energy. These would need to be carefully designed and etched, with errors potentially leading to malfunction or dangerous feedback.
    
6. **Alchemy and Potion Inputs:** Devices might require alchemical concoctions or specific magical ingredients to function. The preparation of these could be a skill in itself, involving gathering and combining ingredients in precise ways.
    
7. **Magical Tuning and Calibration:** Devices might need regular tuning or calibration by a skilled magic user. This process would be akin to tuning a musical instrument, requiring precision and a fine understanding of magical harmonics.
    
8. **Consciousness Link:** Some devices could be linked to the consciousness of the user, responding to mental commands or thoughts. This requires a deep meditative connection with the device, and perhaps risks to the user if the connection is misused or strained.
    
9. **Environmental Magic Harnessing:** Devices could draw power from magical ley lines or natural phenomena in the environment. Users might need to place the device in specific locations or ensure environmental conditions are right for it to function.
    
10. **Magical Crafting and Customization:** Emphasize the crafting aspect, where each magical device is unique and requires careful construction and personalization by a skilled artisan or mage. This makes each device a work of art and science, deeply imbued with the creator's intent and skill.

### Magic vs Technology 

- **Elemental Imbalance:** Technology, being largely mechanical and lacking in inherent magical properties, could disrupt the elemental balance crucial to the functioning of your world. For instance, excessive use of technology might drain or distort elemental energies, leading to environmental catastrophes, weakening of magical fields, or the disruption of natural cycles. This inherent risk makes societies rely more on magic, which is naturally attuned to maintaining elemental harmony.
	- A machine would be a strong expression of one element, and that will need to be balanced, either by a living being or by binding an elemental pair.
    
- **Vulnerability to Magical Interference:** Technological devices could be extremely susceptible to magical interference. In a world where magic is prevalent, this makes technology unreliable. For example, a simple enchantment could easily disable a complex machine, or ambient magical energies could interfere with electronic components. This inherent vulnerability makes technology a less desirable choice in a world where magic is a common force.
    - Magical devices must have a balance of the elements or they may be reliable. The Earth element, especially, helps to "ground" the device, making it's operation more stable. Thus, many enchantments are tied to locations, made from stone or etchings.

- **Magical Adaptation and Evolution:** In your world, magic could have a living quality, constantly adapting and evolving. This means magical solutions are often more versatile and capable of dealing with unexpected changes or challenges. Technology, being static, cannot adapt or evolve on its own, making it less effective in the long term.
    
- **Cultural and Spiritual Significance:** Magic might hold a deep cultural or spiritual significance that technology lacks. In this world, magical practices could be intertwined with the society’s beliefs, values, and traditions, making magic an integral part of life that technology cannot replace.
    
- **Economic and Social Structure:** The economy and social hierarchy of your world could be built around magic. Those with magical abilities or knowledge might hold significant power and influence, creating a social structure that favors the use of magic over technology.
    
- **Magical Creatures and Beings:** The presence of magical creatures and beings could render technology ineffective or dangerous. For instance, a machine might work perfectly in a non-magical environment but fail spectacularly in the presence of magical beasts or in areas of strong magical energy.
	- **Predatory Flora and Fauna:** The existence of predatory plants or creatures that are attracted to or feed on the energy or materials of technology could make the use of such devices dangerous.
- **Relativistic Effects of Different Planes:** If your world includes multiple planes of existence with different physical laws or relativistic effects, technology developed in one plane might not function properly in another. For example, time dilation or differing gravitational forces could render technological devices useless or unstable when moved between planes.
- **Inherent Instability of Physical Laws:** If the physical laws of your world are not constant but fluctuate – perhaps due to the influence of different planes or magical forces – this would make the development of consistent, reliable technology extremely challenging.
- **Isolation of Knowledge Centers:** If the centers of technological knowledge or advancement are geographically or dimensionally isolated (such as being on different planes or inaccessible parts of the world), the spread of technological innovation could be severely limited.
    
- **Effects of Celestial Bodies:** Unique celestial phenomena, like intense solar flares, magnetic field anomalies, or peculiar cosmic radiations, could interfere with or damage technological equipment, making reliance on such devices risky or unreliable.

### Limitations of Technology
the creation of powerful technology is akin to creating powerful magic but without the elemental balance. Magical items require either precise tuning or the 'binding' of an elemental to function. Devices made without these constraints either: 1) is unstable and either operates unreliably or loses its power over time or 2) accidentally entraps an elemental that either willfully destroys the device or goes mad while entrapped.

- **Unstable Technology Mechanic:**
    
    - **Crafting and Usage:** When a player crafts or uses a technological device, they must make a skill check (e.g., Intelligence + Engineering or Arcana). The success of this check determines the stability and effectiveness of the device.
    - **Instability Table:** Create a table of possible outcomes for failed checks, ranging from minor malfunctions to catastrophic failures or loss of power over time. The severity of the outcome can be based on the margin of failure.
    - **Maintenance and Repair:** Players can perform maintenance checks periodically to keep devices stable. Failure in maintenance can lead to gradual deterioration or sudden failure of the device.
    
- **Elemental Entrapment Mechanic:**
    
    - **Creation Process:** When creating a device, players can choose to risk entrapment of an elemental. This could grant the device enhanced powers or efficiency.
    - **Entrapment Check:** Implement a check (e.g., Wisdom or Charisma) to determine if an elemental is entrapped during the device’s creation. The difficulty of this check depends on the power of the device.
    - **Consequences of Entrapment:** If an elemental is entrapped, roll on a table to determine its reaction – ranging from compliant (enhancing the device) to resistant (causing malfunctions) to hostile (actively seeking to destroy the device or escape).
    - **Negotiation and Pacification:** Players with skills in diplomacy or magical negotiation can attempt to pacify or bargain with the entrapped elemental, altering its behavior.
- **Balancing Elemental Forces:**
    
    - **Elemental Alignment:** Devices should be crafted with an awareness of elemental balance. Players must choose which elemental force they align their device with.
    - **Elemental Interaction:** Devices interacting with opposing elemental forces in the environment or in use (like a fire-aligned device used in a water-dominant area) can have reduced efficiency or face adverse effects.
    - **Harmonization:** Players with knowledge in elemental magic can attempt to harmonize the device with surrounding elemental forces, enhancing its stability and performance.
