# Theory of Magic
## Magic in the Manifold Realms
Magic can take many forms, from innate qualities to studied forms, a simple thought to an elaborate ritual. What all magic has in common is the manipulation of the magic septessence that exists in every living and nonliving thing, although it is not distributed evenly. Manipulation of Septessence always produces some vibration, this can be audible like a spoken word or tone, a felt vibration, a mental tingle, or even the crumbling of an expended material. The act of casting of a magic spell or ability varies depending on the caster, but is likewise accompanied by a spoken incantation, a music chord, a banging drum, or crushing of material component. The casting of a spell could be obvious or subtle, and the effect can always be discerned by one learned in the Arts (via Arcana check or spell like Detect Magic). 

Magic can be naturally acquired (ie sorcerers), mastered through study (ie wizards), or gifted (ie Warlocks, Clerics). 
## Septessence
 Septessence (name subject to change) is what those that study the Arts know mediates all magical effects. The concentration of Septessence in the lower planes is what gives them properties different form the upper planes.  Septessence grants fantastic powers to those who can wield it, but it also distorts spacetime - meaning that time can be slowed and distances contracted - and the effect increases with the amount of Septessence.
- casting powerful spells takes more time because the concentration of Septessence literally slows down time around the caster.
- drawing too much magic can cause a crushing pain from the contraction of coma from the loss of time

### Spell Effects
- Dispel magic/Haste/Time stop: The caster ends magical effects by dispersing Septessence. At high enough power, the area of effect becomes a bubble in time, allowing those inside to act while everything around is still. The other side effect is that to those inside the bubble the space around them would appear to recede away from them, making it hard to see outside. Of course, spells can't be cast inside the bubble because of the lack of Septessence. 
- Clairvoyance/scrying: the caster concentrates spacetime to bring a certain point in the distance closer to their vision. The caster experiences their vision rapidly approaching them until the target comes into focus. The further the target, the longer it takes to cast spell, and extreme distances or locations on other planes would also experience a noticeable time dilation effect. If you attempt to scry a location on a higher plane or far away, you will see time passing very quickly at the destination. It will be hard to see details and it maybe hard to get timely information at all. Scrying a lower realm has the benefit of the time gradient working in your favor, making it considerably more effective to scry on a lower realm since your target will be moving slower allowing you to take in more details.

Haste - takes you to the upper edge of your plane and grants you the effects of extra time. You may detected by those in the plane above you. 

Shadow spells - take you to the lower edge of your plane. You're invisible, but slowed and may be detected by those on the plane below you

## Magic and the Planes
-  what effect does the differening magic concentration have?
	- slower/faster recovery of magic
	- empowered effects?

## Wizard Factions
- Geometers (geometry/geomancy): uses shapes and drawings to channel magical power. Especially adept at creating permanent magic through alignment of buildings or markers. 
- Numerists (arithmetic/numerancy): focuses on the special properties of numbers, the mystical conjunctions of primes, and transcendentals, etc. Their calculations can be written out into enormous tables of numbers or tallies of arcane figures, or even woven into patterns. Their rivalry with the Geometers centers on the purity of their abstraction into numbers versus the reliance on pictures and drawings. 
- Bards (Musicology): Study the how the patterns of the universe are reflected in music. Compute the harmonic and aharmonic chords and the melodic progressions of scales that attune to and even manipulate the world around them.

> [!Info] Behind the Scenes
> **Dark Energy as Septessence**
> 
> According to Einstein's theory of General Relativity, the presence of mass (or energy) warps the fabric of spacetime. This warping effect leads to the phenomenon known as time dilation, where time appears to pass slower in a stronger gravitational field compared to a weaker one. This has been experimentally confirmed with precise atomic clocks on Earth and in space.
> 
> Dark matter, though it does not interact with electromagnetic forces, does contribute to the total mass-energy content of the universe, and hence it also warps spacetime. If there was a significant increase in the amount of dark matter in our vicinity, it could, in theory, increase the degree of this warping effect and thus impact the rate at which time passes.
>
> **Dark Matter**
>
>Dark matter is a type of matter thought to account for approximately 85% of the matter in the universe and about a quarter of its total massâ€“energy density or about 2.241 x 10^-27 kg/m^3. It's called "dark" because it does not appear to interact with the electromagnetic field, which means it does not absorb, reflect, or emit electromagnetic radiation, and is therefore difficult to detect.
>
>If Earth suddenly had more dark matter nearby, it might not directly impact life on Earth or the planet's structure itself in any perceptible way, primarily because dark matter interacts very weakly with ordinary matter. It does not interact electromagnetically, which means it doesn't experience friction or collide in the traditional sense. This is one of the reasons it's so hard to detect and why we don't notice the dark matter that is already passing through the Earth.
>
>However, the presence of additional dark matter could have other, more indirect effects. For example, dark matter is believed to play a crucial role in structure formation in the universe. Its gravitational effects cause it to act as a kind of "scaffolding" on which ordinary matter arranges itself. If there were suddenly more dark matter in our vicinity, it might affect the orbits of objects in our Solar System or even nearby star systems over a very long time period, due to its additional gravitational influence.
