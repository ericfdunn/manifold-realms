# The Planes of the Manifold Realms

Something happened thousands of years ago that changed the course of time and space, but the people of Earth lost this history after a long ice age. There were the arcane arts of the ancient past, but now there are new ways people can use magical powers and there is a curiously close relationship with other worlds above and below. 

Earth (the prime material plane) lies in the middle layer of the planes. As you move to the planes above or below, the world becomes increasingly different in a number of ways. Time flows down from the upper planes, so many days pass there for each day in a lower plane. On the other hand, the presence of magic is greater in the lower planes and this means that spells and magical effects will be more powerful there. 

> [!Info] The Physics of the Planes
> The differences between the planes are due to effects in line with [Einstein's Theory of Relativity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_relativity). When something is more massive or moving faster, its internal clock slows down and it shortens in the direction of movement. The magnitude of this effect is called the [Lorentz factor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorentz_factor), and that's what differs between the planes. 
> 
> Mass and velocity alone, however, could not produce a Lorentz factor sufficient to make the different passage of time noticeable without also creating a crushing gravitational force or flinging the world apart. Instead, we add a [cosmological constant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmological_constant) to create the desired effects on each plane and reduce the speed of light to greatly increase the observed affect of these changes. 
> 
> The cosmological constant on each plane is caused by the amount of magical energy present on that plane, see [[Theory of Magic]] for more on that, and the lowered speed of light will have a number of interesting effects that will be described elsewhere.
### Traveling between planes
Certain locations on adjacent planes "overlap" more than others. In rare cases, the geography allows you to move between them without magic, but it is more violent. Enchanted locations ease the transition between planes, but these are rarer as you descend the planes, and are usually guarded. A spell can help you move between planes, but the difficulty of casting varies by location. Overlapping nodes are easier, use a planar skill check to identify if the area you are in is a good location. A more difficult skill check indicates what direction to move to find a better overlap. Moving between planes in an arbitrary location is probably impossible, even with magic.  When you move to an upper plane, you feel the lurch forward and feel lighter, while moving down you feel the sudden weight and fall. 
## The Planes
The major planes, from highest to lowest.
### Elysia
![Elysia](</Images/banner-plane1.jpg>)

Elysia or Apeiron is widely considered to be a myth or even hypothetical place, as no records of visitors are known. Information gathered through deduction and divination describes the flat ground made of course regolith and still water, the cosmos looms above, and the horizon is only visible as a faint glow. Scholars suggest that time might flow variably here, or not at all, and no one knows what travel on this plane could mean.
### Kleos
![Kleos](</Images/banner-plane2.jpg>)

Kleos is an ancient realm where the passage of time has left the detritus of countless eons. Since this is the uppermost inhabited plane, hundreds of years pass here for every year on Earth. During this long history, a diverse number of kingdoms have risen and fallen, spanning otherworldly landscapes of plains, seas, and islands in the sky. Current inhabitants range from utopian enclaves of celestial beings living on engineered skyships to mutated insectoids crawling deserts that were scorched of life a hundred times over. The one thing they all have in common is an strong adherence to the principles and hard-won knowledge that have maintained them so long.
### Skai
![Skai](</Images/banner-plane3.jpg>)

Skai is the highlands of the highest peaks and rolling hills atop the clouds that pass over Earth. Home to ancient Elven kingdoms, Dwarven enclaves, and mysterious societies of Giants. Although Skai also experienced the Ice Age, the long-lived people here have created societies and works far beyond those of Earth below. Still, they compare themselves to the legends of Kleos and struggle against each other to attain the greatest heights. Time and distances are about four times greater than those on Earth, but the gravity is slightly less, which makes it suitable for the larger Giants.
### Earth
![Earth](</Images/banner-plane4.jpg>)

A familiar place where humans have lived for countless generations. It is believed that the wizards of ancient Earth were the ones that split the planes, bringing the heavens down and precipitating an Ice Age that covered the entire planet for an age. It has now been about a thousand years since the end of that age, and there is still much for the growing societies of humans to discover about their past and their neighboring planes.
### Maya
![Maya](</Images/banner-plane5.jpg>)

Maya has a strong presence of natural forces and strange creatures, the sky is a haze above
the trees of enchanted forests and mysterious sea floors. It is home to elemental fey spirits and humanoid animal folk that make their homes in the wilderness or clustered in small villages. The dynamic environment of Maya forces the inhabitants here to strive for harmony with the natural cycles. Although Maya was not frozen, the Ice Age was felt here, and as a result of that and the slower passage of time, the societies are still quite young and look up to those on Earth with curiosity. 
### Naraka
![Naraka](</Images/banner-plane6.jpg>)

Naraka is subterranean networks, active volcanoes with lakes of lava, crystalline caves, and fathomless depths. The ground shakes with tectonic activity and the industry of those that extract the great wealth of ores, gems, and magical resources. This is the natural environment of Dragons, Orcs, Demons, and other opportunists that compete viciously to make the most of this difficult place where space is limited and even the gravity is oppressive. Time is not on your side in Naraka either, as every day here a month passes on Earth. A fact that agitates further conflict and greed.
### Arkhe
![Arkhe](</Images/banner-plane7.jpg>)

Arkhe is a dark, primal place. Ancient entropic forces are still young here due to the stillness of time. A wind washes over the surface of loose gravel; ash and pumice rain from the sky, which is the glowing accretion of dark star. There are no known living inhabitants here, probably just ghosts that haunt the surface and Other things much worse besides. Philosophers argue whether Arkhe is the source or resting point for all the souls that pass through the Manifold Realms, but all agree that no mortal being would survive a trip there.
## Planar Statistics

Each plane has been uniquely shaped by its history and the presence of the magic Septessence that is unevenly distributed throughout the Cosmos. Septessence is drawn more strongly down into the lower planes, causing them to be empowered with magic, but reduced in space and time. 
- **Time and Distance:** Each plane has its own Lorentz factor, given relative to Earth below, that describes how spacetime is scaled. For example, a traveler from Earth to Skai could stay for four days and return home to see that one day has passed. Likewise, if the travel to Maya, a visit of one day would pass four days back on Earth. Distances, however, are also stretched by the same amount. So, if our Earth visitor entered Maya, traveled one mile, and then returned to Earth they would find themselves 4 miles from their starting point. This introduces a general trade-off for travel. It may be possible for travelers to go down one plane to shorten the distance of their trip, but the overall time of the trip would remain about the same unless they can take advantage of a shortcut. Beware, though, as any obstructions encountered on the lower plane could drastically delay the completion of your trip at home
- **Gravity:** Each plane has a slightly different gravitational force due to the plane's contraction and amount of Septessence, given relative to Earth below. The slight differences in gravity in the Earth-adjacent planes can be noticed when traveling from one plane to the next, but does not have an mechanical effect on players. The gravity of the outer planes, however, introduce advantages or disadvantages as shown in the table. The gravity effects are cumulative. For example, Creatures on Elysia get the effects listed there and those listed for Kleos. Creatures native to the lower planes are considered naturalized to the effects of their home plane and do not suffer the disadvantages.
- **Magic Strength:** The powerful effect of magic on the lower planes is not missed on the denizens of these planes, while people of the upper planes rely less on magical abilities. Magical affects and the recovery of spent magic are altered as shown in the table below.

>[!Tip] Playing the Planes
>The upper planes are bigger than the lower planes, so that though you have more time in a higher plane, you must travel that much farther to cover the same distance in a lower plane. Lower planes could provide "shortcuts", but could become time sinks if you tarry or are waylaid. The higher planes have slightly less gravity, and the lower planes slightly more, but this only starts to come into effect in the more distant planes and thus there are more flying creatures, floating vessels and cities, and clouds. 
>
>Eschewing the cliche good and evil dichotomy, the higher planes tend instead to have lawful denizens of all alignments, while the lower planes have chaotic, shorter - lived creatures. The lower planes are extremely rich with natural resources, being constantly renewed by volcanic, tectonic, and meteoric activity. Many creatures and plants spring to life first here, and may spread to the upper planes. Creatures of the higher planes have eons of evolution that have lead to their longer lifespans and/or stable societies. That being said these "higher" beings are not necessarily more virtuous, and for those with the knowledge, the temptation is strong to exploit the resources of the lower planes or their peoples. Throughout history there are many tales of powerful beings who have tapped into great power beyond their plane, but often brought ruin or fall. The origin of many species and magical places was made this way.
