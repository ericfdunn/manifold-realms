# The Elements

There are seven #elements that make up the world. The first six in combination make up all mater, while the #void element surrounds and binds them together. Each element represents a philosophical essence of a substance or being, not necessarily their true composition. The elements are more strongly associated with energies of certain types.
 
| Element | Essence | Energy |
|---------|-----------|------------|
| #Earth | Solidity, support | force, bludgeoning  |
| #Water | Motion, potential | acid, cold  |
| #Fire  | Action, consumption | fire, radiant  |
| #Air   | Change, creativity | cold, thunder  |
| #Metal | Quality, attainment | lightning, slashing  |
| #Wood  | Adaptation, growth | poison, piercing  |
| #Void  | Space, binding | necrotic, force  |

## Color Confinement

Individual #elements do not occur in isolation, they are always bound in groups of two or three by the #void element. There are two ways elements may come in existence:

1. **An opposing pair forming nonliving matter**
	An element comes into existence with its opposite and can never be fully separate from it or it will cease to exist. An element's opposite is not an ideological or physical opponent, but more a fact of existence.
2. **A triplet of three different colors forming a living being**
	Living beings are more than simple matter, they are a synthesis of many different energies to have a life force and karma. The three colors combine to form the white, animating light of life. If any of the colors was missing, the being would die or become a ghost. The color of an element can vary, allowing a living being to be composed of any three non-opposing elements (8 combinations).

### Elemental Opposition Pairs

| Element | Opposite | Inert Form | Existence |
|---------|----------|-----------|------|
| #Earth | #Air | dust | Earth supports air and air animates earth  |
| #Water | #Metal| rust | Metal draws water and water dissolves metal  |
| #Fire  | #Wood | ash | Wood fuels fire and fire shapes wood |

- **Earth/Air:**
- **Water/Metal:**
- **Fire/Wood** Without fuel, fire will extinguish, that is easy to see, but why is Fire a necessary part of Wood? That is because without the action of Fire, there is no growth. Much like a forest fire leaves the ground fertile and ready for new life to spring up. It is a necessary part of the ecology of the universe and without it, Wood grows old and weak.

Water: Spells of Water element harness the fluidity of emotions and the adaptable nature of water. They include spells that manipulate water, create healing or soothing effects, allow for shape-shifting or transformation, and grant abilities to adapt to different situations or environments.

Metal: Spells of Metal element focus on structure, order, and the purifying aspects of magic. They encompass spells that create barriers or protective shields, enhance durability or resilience, bestow abilities to manipulate or control metal, and enable the purification or removal of negative energies or influences.

Fire: Spells of Fire element channel the intense passion and transformative power of flames. They include spells that conjure fire or flames, deal damage through fiery explosions or radiant energy, enable transmutation or rapid movement, and grant abilities to inspire or embolden others.

Wood: Spells of Wood element tap into the energy of growth and vitality. They encompass spells that manipulate plant life, promote healing and rejuvenation, enhance natural resilience or stamina, grant abilities related to plant-based camouflage or communication, and provide spells that summon creatures or allies from the natural world.

Air: Spells of Air element harness the freedom of movement and the subtle power of winds. They include spells that create gusts of wind or manipulate air currents, grant abilities of flight or enhanced mobility, provide divination or insight through the whispering winds, and bestow powers of inspiration or mental clarity.

Earth: Spells of Earth element draw upon stability, grounding, and the strength of the earth. They encompass spells that shape the earth or manipulate rocks and minerals, provide defensive or protective barriers, grant abilities of enhanced endurance or resilience, and enable abilities to sense or communicate with the earth itself.

Void: Spells of Void element tap into the mysterious emptiness and binding force that connects all things. They include spells that disrupt or nullify magic, create portals or dimensional rifts, grant abilities related to invisibility or intangibility, and provide powers of insight or understanding of the hidden or unknown.

> [!Info] Behind the Scenes
> The elements of Sevenfold are based on a combination of Platonic, Buddhist, and Chinese elemental theory. Color Confinement is a property of Quantum Chromodynamics, which necessitates three pairs of elements (six total) that represent quarks plus a seventh to represent the gluon.

## Binding
While a true "living" being has three different colored elements. A single element is just one color, and so is not "material" until bound to some form. This binding requires conjuration magic. Mortals can bind an elemental to almost any form of matter temporarily (as in a summoning spell) or to another creature, which lasts until the creature dies or is dispelled.
The Aelph were a creation of powerful magic, binding their elemental force permanently to a form constructed of the material of Aelfrice, a form modeled and named after the race of High Elves. However, the Aelph are still not completely real and will appear ghostly and weak in the light of the sun.

### Summoning Spells
During generic creature #summoning, some matter must be present for the elemental to be called forth and bound. This could be earth, leaves, or sticks that take the form of an animal for a Conjure Animals spell. Once the material is animated, the creature becomes indistinguishable from a real creature of that type unless closely inspected. 
On the other hand, a summoned elemental is a pure expression of that element and takes form from the pure skill and exertion of the spellcaster, not requiring any specific matter to be present.
To summon a creature with intelligence, the specific individual must be known and named. They must be on an adjacent plane and not somehow warded against translocation. The creature may make a Charisma save to resist the summoning, and circumstances may impose an advantage or disadvantage on that check.

# Valence
Every living being has karma and valence, which are products of its journey through lifetimes. Karma is the total potential of the being, and it can be increased or decreased through it's lifetime, but the result of the change will not come until rebirth. The Valence indicates the plane where you were born. The planes are numbered from bottom to top.

| Valence | Plane | Note |
|---------|-------|------|
| 0 | #Arkhe | only ghosts |
| 1 | #Naraka |
| 2 | #Maya |
| 3 | #Urth |
| 4 | #Skai |
| 5 | #Kleos |
| - | #Elysia | liberation |

## Samsara
The path of valence between lifetimes is said to follow a defined set of steps.   the same pattern as the periodic table, starting at the lowest karma (energy) and cycling through the valences as it moves progressively higher.

| Karma         | Valence     | # Lives |
|--------------|-----------|------------|
| 0 | 0 (Arkhe) | ghost      |
| 1 | 1 (Hell) | 1  |
| 2 | 1 (Hell) | 1  |
| 2 | 2 (Fey)  | 3  |
| 4 | 1 (Hell) | 1  |
| 4 | 3 (Fey)  | 3  |
| 3 | 2 (Fey)  | 3  |


After death, a quark's valence may move up or down its journey through increase, decrease, or remain the same based on the karma of that lifetime.
