Parmenides: On Nature 

One path alone is true, unchanging, whole, 
Eternal, indivisible, and sole. 
Unborn, undying, homogenous, too, 
Immutable, it cannot fade from view. 
In it, no parts, no motion can be found, 
No coming-to-be, no passing away sound. 
This Truth remains, impervious to harm, 
The only being, steadfast and alarm.

But now, my friend, I turn to mortal view, 
Where falsehood reigns and error misconstrue. 
They speak of two, with substance opposed, 
And marks distinct, as if they were composed. 
One, fire of heaven, light, and thin, and bright, 
The other, dark night, heavy, and tight. 
Yet neither interacts, no bond or tie, 
Both separate, both in the world, and nigh. 
The heavens, the stars, the earth, and the moon, 
All rise and fall, their stories to be hewn. 
Circles of fire, and darkness, they keep, 
Guided by the divinity, deep. 
The moon, by night shining with borrowed light, 
Always straining her eyes to the sun's might.
