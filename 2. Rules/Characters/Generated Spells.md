>[!Tip] Control Plants
>**Spell Level:** 4th level
>**School of Magic:** Transmutation
>**Casting Time:** 1 action
>**Range:** 150 feet
>**Components:** V, S, M (a handful of dirt)
>**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 hour

You exert an otherworldly influence over plants in the area. Choose an area of terrain no larger than 100 feet on a side within range. You can target plants within this area, causing them to either animate or wilt, depending on the terrain. The terrain types and their effects are as follows:

-   Grassland, forest, or underground: Grasses, weeds, bushes, and trees within the area become animated, and can be directed to entangle creatures within range. Creatures must succeed on a Strength saving throw or be restrained by the plants for the spell's duration.
-   Swamp or marsh: You cause the water and mud to thicken, becoming difficult terrain for creatures within range. Additionally, vines and other plants grow up from the mud, creating an area of difficult terrain and providing cover for creatures.
-   Desert or rocky terrain: You cause the plants within the area to wither and die, becoming difficult terrain for creatures within range. Additionally, the area becomes heavily obscured by dust and sand kicked up by the wind.

You can choose to exclude certain types of plants from the spell's effects, such as those that you deem particularly valuable or those that are being used as cover by friendly creatures. Additionally, the spell has no effect on plant creatures or magical plants, such as those created by the awaken spell.

## Control Plants

-   Spell Level: 4th level
-   School of Magic: Transmutation
-   Casting Time: 1 action
-   Range: Self (30-foot radius)
-   Components: V, S
-   Duration: Concentration, up to 1 hour
-   Description: You take control of plants in a 30-foot radius around you. You can cause plants to grow, entwine around creatures, or animate to attack your enemies.

When you cast this spell, choose one of the following options:

-   **Entangle.** Plants in the area become animate and reach for any creatures in the area. Targets must make a Strength saving throw or become restrained until the spell ends. A creature can use its action to make a Strength check against your spell save DC to free itself or another creature restrained by the plants.
-   **Grow.** Plants in the area grow rapidly and provide cover for you and your allies. The plants provide heavy cover and are difficult terrain for your enemies. Additionally, creatures within the area gain the benefits of half-cover for the duration of the spell.
-   **Animate.** You imbue the plants in the area with a semblance of life, causing them to lash out at your enemies. You can choose up to six plants in the area to animate. An animated plant uses your spell attack modifier to make a melee spell attack against a creature within its reach. On a hit, the target takes 3d6 bludgeoning damage.

At Higher Levels: When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, the radius of the area affected by the spell increases by 10 feet for each slot level above 4th.

Sure, here is a possible D&D 5e spell block for Animate Plants at 7th level:

## **Animate Plants**

7th-level transmutation

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** 60 feet

**Components:** V, S, M (a sprig of mistletoe)

**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

You imbue a number of plants within range with mobility and a semblance of life, causing them to animate and follow your commands. Choose up to six plants that are within 60 feet of you, and each one must be no larger than Huge. These plants become awakened, gaining the following statistics:

- AC: 16
- Hit Points: 10 + your spellcasting ability modifier
- Speed: 20 feet
- Damage Immunities: psychic
- Condition Immunities: blinded, deafened, frightened, paralyzed, poisoned
- Senses: Blindsight 10 ft. (blind beyond this radius)
- Languages: Understands the languages you speak

In combat, the awakened plants can take a move and an action on your turn. You can use a bonus action to mentally command any of the plants to take the Attack, Dash, Disengage, Dodge, or Help action on its turn. You can also use your action to control the plants' movement and actions.

At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 8th level or higher, the number of plants you can animate increases by two for each slot level above 7th.

## Spell Ideas:

Preparations: 7th level Divination. 
	you may make preparations in advance
	and only reveal them when the time is right. Once per
	Adventuring phase, you may activate this ability and
	describe actions you took in the past that were unknown
	to the rest of the player-heroes, but that have now come
	to light. You must then make a suitable skill check to
	determine how successful these preparations were.
	
	Example uses of this ability might include:
	“I found this ancient map on another adventure, and
	I reveal it now.”
	“I sent word to our allies in Rohan a week ago, and
	they are going to arrive to bolster our defences just
	before the Orcs attack.”
	“I guessed the King would imprison us, which is why I
	bribed the jailer a week ago to hide a key behind this
	loose brick.”
	“I just happened to bring along these fireworks.”

Telepathy 17: Charisma save to implant one thought the target thinks is their own.


## Binding in D&D 5E:

-   Spell Level: 5th level
-   School of Magic: Abjuration
-   Casting Time: 1 minute
-   Range: 60 feet
-   Components: V, S, M (a strip of white cloth)
-   Duration: Concentration, up to 1 hour
-   Description: You attempt to bind a creature within range by creating a magical restraint that holds it in place. Choose a creature that you can see within range. The target must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, it is bound by magical chains and restrained for the spell's duration.

While restrained, the creature can't move, and its speed becomes 0. It also can't benefit from any bonus to its speed. Attack rolls against the creature have advantage, and the creature's attack rolls have disadvantage. The creature also has disadvantage on Dexterity saving throws.

At the end of each of its turns, the target can make another Wisdom saving throw. On a success, the spell ends on the target.

Additionally, the spell has additional effects depending on the target's type:

-   Celestial, elemental, fey, or fiend: The creature has disadvantage on attack rolls against creatures within 30 feet of you.
-   Aberration, beast, construct, dragon, giant, humanoid, monstrosity, oozes, or undead: You can specify a particular activity or task that the target must perform on each of its turns, such as "move to a specific location" or "attack a specific creature". The target must make a Wisdom saving throw at the start of each of its turns. On a failed save, it must follow the specified task for that turn. If the task can't be completed, the creature does nothing that turn.

The spell ends early if you use your action to end it, or if the target is moved beyond the spell's range.

## Bind Elemental in D&D 5E:

-   Spell Level: 5th level
-   School of Magic: Conjuration
-   Casting Time: 1 hour
-   Range: Touch
-   Components: V, S, M (a binding stone or glyph)
-   Duration: Instantaneous
-   Description: You attempt to bind an elemental to your service. You must touch the elemental creature as part of the casting, and it must be within range of the spell. The target must make a Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, it is bound to your will and becomes your faithful servant.

The creature obeys your verbal commands to the best of its ability. You can use your action to command it to take specific actions. If you don't issue any commands to it, the elemental defends itself from hostile creatures but otherwise takes no actions.

If the elemental is ever more than 300 feet away from you, if you issue a command that it is physically unable to perform, or if you release the elemental from the spell's effects, the spell ends and the elemental is no longer bound to your will. At that point, the elemental can act freely and may be hostile towards you if you have previously mistreated it.

The type of elemental you can bind depends on the environment in which you are casting the spell. Here are some examples of the type of elemental you might bind in various environments:

-   Air: Air Elemental
-   Earth: Earth Elemental
-   Fire: Fire Elemental
-   Water: Water Elemental

The DM has the final say on which elemental you can bind, based on the environment and other factors.


## Bind Dragon

-   Spell Level: 9th level
-   School of Magic: Enchantment
-   Casting Time: 1 hour
-   Range: Touch
-   Components: V, S, M (a diamond worth at least 50,000 gold pieces, a live sheep, and a potion of dragon's blood)
-   Duration: Permanent
-   Description: You attempt to bind a dragon to your will. You must touch the dragon as part of the casting, and it must be within range of the spell. The target must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, it is bound to your will and becomes your faithful servant.

The dragon obeys your verbal commands to the best of its ability. You can use your action to command it to take specific actions. If you don't issue any commands to it, the dragon defends itself from hostile creatures but otherwise takes no actions.

The binding is permanent and cannot be broken by any means except for the death of the dragon or the death of the caster. However, the dragon is not necessarily happy about being bound and may seek revenge if it is mistreated or if the caster dies before it does.

As part of the casting of this spell, you must sacrifice a live sheep and pour the potion of dragon's blood over the diamond used as a material component, destroying all three items in the process. If you don't have all of these components, the spell fails.

Additionally, the DM may require additional tasks or sacrifices to successfully cast this spell depending on the specific dragon being targeted and other factors.


## Iron Tide

-   Spell Level: 3rd level
-   School of Magic: Evocation
-   Casting Time: 1 action
-   Range: Self
-   Components: V, S
-   Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute
-   Description: You summon a tide of iron to protect yourself and your allies. When you cast the spell, you and each creature of your choice within 30 feet of you gain temporary hit points equal to your level + your Charisma modifier (minimum of 1).

While the spell is active, you and your allies gain the following benefits:

-   Resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from non-magical weapons.
-   Advantage on Strength checks and Strength saving throws.
-   Your melee attacks deal an extra 1d6 bludgeoning damage.

At Higher Levels: When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the temporary hit points gained by you and your allies increase by 5 for each slot level above 3rd. Additionally, the extra damage dealt by your melee attacks increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 3rd.

## Rain of Steel

-   Spell Level: 4th level
-   School of Magic: Evocation
-   Casting Time: 1 action
-   Range: Self (30-foot cone)
-   Components: V, S, M (a piece of steel)
-   Duration: Instantaneous
-   Description: You call forth a rain of steel upon your enemies. Each creature in a 30-foot cone must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 6d8 slashing damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

Additionally, any non-magical weapons held by the affected creatures are destroyed by the hail of steel. Magical weapons take damage as normal, and can be destroyed if they fail a Dexterity saving throw with disadvantage.

At Higher Levels: When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 4th.

## Soul Siphon

-   Spell Level: 2nd level
-   School of Magic: Necromancy
-   Casting Time: 1 action
-   Range: Touch
-   Components: V, S
-   Duration: Instantaneous
-   Description: You draw upon the life essence of a creature to restore your own vitality or that of an ally. When you cast the spell, you touch a creature and drain its life force, restoring a number of hit points equal to 2d8 + your spellcasting ability modifier to either you or the target creature.

At Higher Levels: When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the healing increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 2nd.

Note that as a Necromancy spell, this may have some roleplaying implications for your Warlock character. The DM may also require a Charisma check to avoid causing discomfort or disgust to other characters with your use of dark magic.

"Expedite Healing" as a 2nd-level spell for Rangers:

-   Spell Level: 2nd level
-   School of Magic: Conjuration
-   Casting Time: 1 action
-   Range: Touch
-   Components: V, S
-   Duration: Instantaneous
-   Description: You channel the energy of nature to accelerate the natural healing process of a creature. When you cast the spell, you touch a creature and restore a number of hit points equal to 2d6 + your spellcasting ability modifier. Additionally, the target creature regains its ability to spend Hit Dice to regain hit points, as if it had completed a short rest.

At Higher Levels: When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the healing increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 2nd.

## Destructive Smite

-   Spell Level: 2nd level
-   School of Magic: Evocation
-   Casting Time: 1 bonus action
-   Range: Self
-   Components: V
-   Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute
-   Description: You imbue your weapon with a destructive energy that lashes out at your enemies. The next time you hit a creature with a melee weapon attack during the spell's duration, your weapon flares with white-hot energy, dealing an extra 3d6 points of damage of the type that your weapon normally deals. The spell ends after the first time you hit a creature with the extra damage.

At Higher Levels: When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the extra damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 2nd.

Note that this spell can be a powerful tool for a Paladin in combat, allowing them to deal significant damage to a single target with a melee weapon attack. However, as a concentration spell, it can be disrupted by taking damage or failing a concentration check.


## Bind Elemental (Beast Form)

-   Spell Level: 5th level
-   School of Magic: Conjuration
-   Casting Time: 1 hour
-   Range: 60 feet
-   Components: V, S, M (a gemstone worth at least 500 gp, which the spell consumes)
-   Duration: Until Dispelled
-   Description: You call forth an elemental creature and bind it into the body of a willing or unconscious beast within range, transforming it into a powerful and obedient ally. The elemental creature must be willing to be bound in this way, and the beast must be of the same size category as the elemental (Large or smaller).

When you cast the spell, make a Charisma check contested by the elemental's Wisdom check. If you succeed, the elemental is bound to the beast form and becomes subservient to your will. The beast form gains the elemental's type and any traits and abilities, including resistances, immunities, senses, and movement modes. The beast form also gains any special abilities of the elemental creature, such as breath weapons, natural attacks, or spellcasting abilities.

The elemental creature remains bound to the beast form until it is dispelled, at which point it returns to its original form. You can dismiss the spell at any time, causing the elemental creature to be released from the beast form.

At Higher Levels: When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, you can bind an elemental creature of a larger size category (up to Huge) and/or increase the duration of the spell by 1 day for each slot level above 5th.

## Death's Resurgence

-   Spell Level: 4th level
-   School of Magic: Necromancy
-   Casting Time: Reaction (when you slay a creature)
-   Range: Self
-   Components: V, S
-   Duration: Instantaneous
-   Description: When you slay a creature, you can call upon the power of death to restore yourself to full health and vitality. You regain hit points equal to twice the slain creature's challenge rating or level, whichever is higher. In addition, you gain temporary hit points equal to your caster level (maximum 20).

At Higher Levels: When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, the amount of temporary hit points increases by 5 for each slot level above 4th.

Note that this spell can be a powerful tool for a Cleric in combat, allowing them to recover quickly after slaying a foe. However, it can only be cast as a reaction when a creature is killed, which means the Cleric must time their attacks carefully to make use of the spell's effects. Additionally, the spell's reliance on killing enemies means that it may not be a good fit for all playstyles or characters.

## Eldritch Resurgence

-   Spell Level: 3rd level
-   School of Magic: Necromancy
-   Casting Time: Reaction (when you slay a creature)
-   Range: Self
-   Components: V, S
-   Duration: Instantaneous
-   Description: When you slay a creature, you can tap into the power of your patron to heal yourself and gain temporary hit points. You regain hit points equal to the slain creature's hit point maximum, and you gain temporary hit points equal to your warlock level + your Charisma modifier (minimum of 1).

At Higher Levels: When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the amount of temporary hit points increases by 5 for each slot level above 3.

Note that this spell shares a similar concept to Death's Resurgence, but is tailored to fit the Warlock class. The Warlock regains hit points equal to the slain creature's hit point maximum, making this a powerful option against tough enemies. The temporary hit points gained scale with the Warlock's level and Charisma modifier, providing a boost to their survivability. Like Death's Resurgence, this spell can only be cast as a reaction when a creature is killed, making timing and positioning important factors to consider.

## Hunter's Respite

-   Spell Level: 2nd level
-   School of Magic: Necromancy
-   Casting Time: Reaction (when you slay a creature)
-   Range: Self
-   Components: V, S
-   Duration: Instantaneous
-   Description: When you slay a creature, you can use the animal's vitality to restore your own. You regain hit points equal to the slain creature's hit point maximum or your ranger level, whichever is higher.

At Higher Levels: When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the amount of hit points regained increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 2nd.

Note that this spell provides a solid source of healing for Rangers after defeating an enemy in combat. The amount of hit points regained scales with the slain creature's hit point maximum or the Ranger's level, providing more healing options for higher-level characters. However, like the other spells that can only be cast as a reaction to slaying a creature, the timing and positioning are important factors to consider in order to make the most of this spell.

## Predator's Instinct

-   Spell Level: 2nd level
-   School of Magic: Divination
-   Casting Time: Reaction (when you slay a creature)
-   Range: Self
-   Components: V, S
-   Duration: 1 minute
    
-   Description: When you slay a creature, you can tap into the instincts of the animal and gain temporary benefits based on the creature's type. Choose one of the following benefits when you cast this spell:
    
    -   Beast: You gain a +5 bonus to your Wisdom (Survival) checks, and you can track other creatures of the same type as the slain beast with advantage.
    -   Aberration: You gain advantage on Intelligence (Investigation) checks to understand and identify aberrations, and you have resistance to psychic damage.
    -   Construct: You gain proficiency with smith's tools and advantage on Strength checks made to break objects.
    -   Dragon: You gain resistance to the damage type associated with the slain dragon's breath weapon (if any), and you have advantage on saving throws against the Frightful Presence ability of dragons.
    -   Elemental: You gain resistance to the damage type associated with the slain elemental, and you have advantage on Constitution saving throws against the effects of extreme temperatures.
    -   Fiend: You gain resistance to fire damage, and you have advantage on Charisma (Intimidation) checks made against fiends.
    -   Giant: You gain proficiency with siege weapons and can carry heavy objects as if they were one size category smaller.
    -   Humanoid: You gain a +5 bonus to Charisma (Persuasion) checks made against other creatures of the same type as the slain humanoid.
    -   Monstrosity: You gain advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks made to detect the presence of monstrosities, and you have advantage on saving throws against the Frightful Presence ability of monstrosities.
    -   Undead: You gain resistance to necrotic damage, and you have advantage on Wisdom saving throws against the effects of undead abilities.

At Higher Levels: When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, you can choose one additional benefit for each slot level above 2nd.

Note that this spell provides temporary benefits based on the type of creature slain, allowing the Ranger to adapt to the situation and use their knowledge of different types of creatures to their advantage. The benefits last for a minute, allowing the Ranger to make use of them for a short time after defeating an enemy in combat. As with the other spells that can only be cast as a reaction to slaying a creature, timing and positioning are important factors to consider.
