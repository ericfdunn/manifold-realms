# Character Creation

## Character dice

Character dice are what determines the strength and power of a player character. They represent that character's ability to perform heroic feats, withstand trials, and wield magic. At each level, you get one hit die, and potentially one technique die and one power die as well.  

- **Hit dice** determine total hit points and natural healing
- **Action dice** are used for physical feats and talents
- **Power Dice** are used for mental feats and casting spells

The size of each die is determined by your class. You can use the table below or determine your own via point buy (standard array is d4, d6, d8, d10). 

 |	**Class** |	**Hit Die** | **Action Die** |	**Power Die** |	**Proficiencies** |
 |--------|----|----|----|----|
 |	**Barbarian** |	 d12 |	 d10 |	 d4 |	2 |
 |	**Bard** |	 d6 |	 d6 |	 d8 |	8 |
 |	**Cleric** |	 d8 |	 d8 |	 d10 |	2 |
 |	**Druid** |	 d8 |	 d6 |	 d10 |	4 |
 |	**Fighter** |	 d10 |	 d10 |	 d4 |	4 |
 |	**Monk** |	 d8 |	 d10 |	 d4 |	6 |
 |	**Paladin** |	 d10 |	 d10 |	 d6 |	2 |
 |	**Ranger** |	 d10 |	 d6 |	 d6 |	6 |
 |	**Rogue** |	 d6 |	 d8 |	 d6 |	8 |
 |	**Sorcerer** |	 d6 |	 d6 |	 d12 |	4 |
 |	**Wizard** |	 d6 |	 d4 |	 d12 |	6 |

### Ability Scores and Maximum Dice
The ability score associated with each die is shown on the table below. For action dice and power dice, they character chooses the ability that will be associated with that die at character creation, usually choosing the highest ability. The mental ability chosen for their power die becomes their spellcasting ability. 

| Character Die | Associated Ability                | Number of dice                   |
| ------------- | --------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| Hit Die       | Constitution                      | Character level                  |
| Action Die    | Strength or Dexterity             | Character level or 1 + Ability bonus |
| Power Die     | Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma | Character level or Ability score                    |

While you always gain a Hit Die at each level, there is a limit to how many Action Dice and Power Dice a player has. Action dice are limited to the associated ability *bonus*. For example, a character with 14 Strength would have a +2 bonus and therefore would have up to 3 Action Dice or their character level, whatever is higher. Power dice are limited to the associated ability *score*. For example, a Wizard with 16 Intelligence would have one Power Die per level until they get to level 17, where their Power dice would be capped to 16. 

The limit for Action dice is much lower than Power dice, but it is easier to get more and  easier to recover. In addition, Power dice can only be used once per turn, while Action dice can be used as many times as you want.

### Bonus Character Dice
Some abilities and circumstances can grant a character a Bonus Action Die or Power Die. These can be used as normal, but they disappear at the end of the encounter or after a specified time.

Circumstances that grant a bonus Action Die:
- Rolling initiative
- Scoring a critical hit?
- Dropping a foe?

### Spending Character Dice
- **Hit Dice.** Hit dice can be spent during a long or short rest to naturally recover hit points. Roll a hit die, add your constitution modifier and heal that many hit points, that die is now ***spent***. You can choose to spend any number of hit dice this way during your rest, but a spent hit die can only be recovered by taking a long rest.
- **Action dice.** Action dice can be used to empower your talents and skills. When you use a talent or skill that allows an Action Die to be applied, you can apply up to your physical ability modifier number of Action dice at one time. When you apply an action die, you roll the die and use the number as specified by the talent. If the talent adds extra damage based on the action die, the damage is the same type as the original attack. If you roll the ***maximum*** number on your Action Die, that die is now ***spent*** and must be recovered to use again.
- **Power dice.** Power dice can be used to empower your spells and powers. You can only spend Power dice once per turn.  When you apply a Power Die, you roll the die and use the number how the talent says. If you roll the ***maximum*** number on your Power Die, that die is now ***spent*** and must be recovered to use again.

### Recovering Character Dice
Character dice can be recovered during long or short rests.
-  **Short rests.** You recover all of your Action Dice in a short rest and can recover Power dice by making a character die check. Roll each spent die and add the appropriate ability modifier. The DC is 10 + 1 for each additional short rest that day. Each die that rolls over the DC is restored to your available dice.
- **Long rests.** During a long rest, you recover all of your Action and Power dice and one Hit die. You can make character dice checks to recover additional hit dice, the DC is 10.

| Die        | Short Rest  | Long Rest              |
| ---------- | ----------- | ---------------------- |
| Action Die | Recover all | Recover all            |
| Power Die  | Dice check  | Recover all            |
| Hit Die    | No recovery | Dice check (minimum 1) |


> [!NOTE] Alternate Rule
> Bonus Recovery: Choose a setting where your character receives a more restorative rest, such as: forest grove for a druid, library for a wizard, temple for a monk. When you take your short rest in that setting, you can add your proficiency bonus to your Character Dice checks.
