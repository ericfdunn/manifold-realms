# Spell Changes

1.  Common spell parameters are grouped into categories:
	- Range: Self, Touch, Close, Short, Long, Extra Long
	- Area: Target, Small, Medium, Large, Extra Large
	- Shape: Target, Cone, Line, Sphere, Cylinder, Square, Wall
2. Most spells have a cantrip form that can be cast at will but produces a limited effect and does not deal damage.
3. Some spells have a ritual form that can be cast at will, but requires at least 10 minutes to cast. The ritual form of a spell typically produces a longer lasting but less powerful or more restricted effect.
4. Instantaneous transportation is not possible in this universe, so there is no Teleport or similar spells, but there are options to travel very quickly.
5. Necromancy does not play a large role in this universe, and thus does not have its own school of magic. Since there are no "souls", it is not possible to Resurrect a creature in the same way and it is equally not possible to harness a soul to create undead. Reanimation spells exist using other schools of magic.

## Other Rules
- Speed enhancements don't stack
- Temporary hit points don't stack
- Temporary character dice don't stack
