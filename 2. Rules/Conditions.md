# Conditions

Conditions alter a creature’s capabilities in a variety of ways and can arise as a result of a spell, a class feature, a monster's attack, or other effect. Most conditions, such as blinded, are impairments, but a few, such as invisible, can be advantageous.

A condition lasts either until it is countered (the prone condition is countered by standing up, for example) or for a duration specified by the effect that imposed the condition.

If multiple effects impose the same condition on a creature, each instance of the condition has its own duration, but the condition’s effects don’t get worse.

A creature either has a condition or doesn’t. The following definitions specify what happens to a creature while it is subjected to a condition.


> [!Info] Changes from 5e
> Stunned and Paralyzed are less severe and are moved into a condition
> Added Burned to have a condition that's relevant to fire and acid damage
> Changed Exhaustion so it's not a cummulative effect that's hard to remember
> Reduced the conditions that cause you to lose a turn
### Blinded
- A blinded creature can’t see and automatically fails any ability check that requires sight.
- Attack rolls against the creature have advantage, and the creature’s attack rolls have disadvantage.
### Burned
A burned creature has a harder time healing. The next healing effect either magical or through spending hit dice, does no healing but removes the burned condition. If the healing effect does multiple dice of healing, the healing is reduced by one die and the burned condition is removed.

Alternate: lose 1 hd
### Charmed
- A charmed creature can’t attack the charmer or target the charmer with harmful abilities or magical effects.
- The charmer has advantage on any ability check to interact socially with the creature.
### Cover
- **Half Cover:** A target with half cover has a +2 bonus to AC and Dexterity saving throws. A target has half cover if an obstacle blocks at least half of its body. The obstacle might be a  low wall, a large piece of furniture, a narrow tree trunk, or a creature, whether that creature is an enemy or a friend.
- **Three-quarters Cover:** A target with three-quarters cover has a +5 bonus to AC and Dexterity saving throws. A target has three-quarters cover if about three-quarters of it is covered by an obstacle. The obstacle might be a portcullis, an arrow slit, or a thick tree trunk.
- **Total Cover:** A target with total cover can’t be targeted directly by an attack or a spell, although some spells can reach such a target by including it in an area of effect. A target has total cover if it is completely concealed by an obstacle.
### Deafened 
- A deafened creature can’t hear and automatically fails any ability check that requires hearing.
### Exhausted
- This Condition is cumulative. Each time you receive it, you gain 1 level of exhaustion. You die if your exhaustion level exceeds 6.  
- When you make an ability check, save, or character dice check, you subtract your exhaustion level from the d20 roll. 
- Subtract your exhaustion level from the Spell save DC of any Spell you cast.
- Finishing a Long Rest removes 1 of your levels of exhaustion. When your exhaustion level reaches 0, you are no longer Exhausted.

Alternate rule: when exhausted, you lose one power die or technique die. If you have none left, you become incapacitated. Choose one die to lose or roll all of them and pick form the highest results.

Alternate rule: Character dice become spent if you roll higher than their max - exhaustion level. If all your character dice are spent, you become incapacitated.
### Frightened
- A frightened creature has disadvantage on ability checks and attack rolls while the source of its fear is within line of sight.
- The creature can’t willingly move closer to the source of its fear.
### Grappled
- A grappled creature’s speed becomes 0, and it can’t benefit from any bonus to its speed.
- The grappler can drag you when it moves if you are at least two sizes smaller, but the movement costs double.
- While Grappled, you can use your action to escape by making a Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check against the grapple's escape DC.
- The condition ends if the grappler is incapacitated or an effect moves the grappled creature out of the grappler's reach.
### Incapacitated
- An incapacitated creature can’t take actions or reactions and ceases concentration on any spells. 
### Invisible
- An invisible creature is impossible to see without the aid of magic or a special sense. For the purpose of hiding, the creature is heavily obscured. The creature’s location can be detected by any noise it makes or any tracks it leaves but it can't be target by spells that require sight.

- The creature automatically fails Strength and Dexterity saving throws.
- Attack rolls against the creature have advantage
- Any attack that hits the creature is a critical hit if the attacker is within 5 feet of the creature.

Alternate (physical attack): A paralyzed creature can't move, drops anything it was holding, and can't take reactions. Attack rolls against the creature have advantage and any attacks have disadvantage.
### Petrified
- A petrified creature is transformed, along with any nonmagical object it is wearing or carrying, into a solid inanimate substance (usually stone). Its weight increases by a factor of ten, and it ceases aging.
- The creature is incapacitated (see the condition), can’t move or speak, and is unaware of its surroundings.
- Attack rolls against the creature have advantage.
- The creature automatically fails Strength and Dexterity saving throws.

# Environmental Effects
By its nature, adventuring involves delving into places that are dark, dangerous, and full of mysteries to be explored. The rules in this section cover some of the most important ways in which adventurers interact with the environment in such places.

### Falling

A fall from a great height is one of the most common hazards facing an adventurer. At the end of a fall, a creature takes 1d6 bludgeoning damage for every 10 feet it fell, to a maximum of 20d6. The creature lands prone, unless it avoids taking damage from the fall.

### Suffocating

A creature can hold its breath for a number of minutes equal to 1 + its Constitution modifier (minimum of 30 seconds).

When a creature runs out of breath or is choking, it can survive for a number of rounds equal to its Constitution modifier (minimum of 1 round). At the start of its next turn, it drops to 0 hit points and is dying, and it can’t regain hit points or be stabilized until it can breathe again.

For example, a creature with a Constitution of 14 can hold its breath for 3 minutes. If it starts suffocating, it has 2 rounds to reach air before it drops to 0 hit points.

### Vision and Light

The most fundamental tasks of adventuring—noticing danger, finding hidden objects, hitting an enemy in combat, and targeting a spell, to name just a few—rely heavily on a character’s ability to see. Darkness and other effects that obscure vision can prove a significant hindrance.

#### Obscured Areas
A given area might be lightly or heavily obscured. In a **lightly obscured** area, such as dim light, patchy fog, or moderate foliage, creatures have disadvantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight.  
A **heavily obscured** area—such as darkness, opaque fog, or dense foliage—blocks vision entirely. A creature effectively suffers from the **blinded** condition when trying to see something in that area.

#### Light
The presence or absence of light in an environment creates three categories of illumination: bright light, dim light, and darkness.

**Bright light** lets most creatures see normally. Even gloomy days provide bright light, as do torches, lanterns, fires, and other sources of illumination within a specific radius.  
**Dim light**, also called shadows, creates a lightly obscured area. An area of dim light is usually a boundary between a source of bright light, such as a torch, and surrounding darkness. The soft light of twilight and dawn also counts as dim light. A particularly brilliant full moon might bathe the land in dim light.  
**Darkness** creates a heavily obscured area. Characters face darkness outdoors at night (even most moonlit nights), within the confines of an unlit dungeon or a subterranean vault, or in an area of magical darkness.

##### Blindsight

A creature with blindsight can perceive its surroundings without relying on sight, within a specific radius. Creatures without eyes, such as oozes, and creatures with echolocation or heightened senses, such as bats and true dragons, have this sense.

##### Darkvision

Many creatures in fantasy gaming worlds, especially those that dwell underground, have darkvision. Within a specified range, a creature with darkvision can see in darkness as if the darkness were dim light, so areas of darkness are only lightly obscured as far as that creature is concerned. However, the creature can’t discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.

##### Truesight

A creature with truesight can, out to a specific range, see in normal and magical darkness, see invisible creatures and objects, automatically detect visual illusions and succeed on saving throws against them, and perceives the original form of a shapechanger or a creature that is transformed by magic. Furthermore, the creature can see into the Ethereal Plane.

### Difficult Terrain

Combat rarely takes place in bare rooms or on featureless plains. Boulder-­strewn caverns, briar-­choked forests, treacherous staircases—the setting of a typical fight contains difficult terrain. Every foot of movement in difficult terrain costs 1 extra foot. This rule is true even if multiple things in a space count as difficult terrain. Low furniture, rubble, undergrowth, steep stairs, snow, and shallow bogs are examples of difficult terrain. The space of another creature, whether hostile or not, also counts as difficult terrain.
