# The Planes of the Manifold Realms

The prime material plane lies in the middle, with planes above and below (and some pockets). Time flows down from the upper planes, so many days pass there for each day in a lower plane. This is because the lower planes 'turn' faster and are heavier, causing a relativistic effect. When you move to an upper plane, you feel the lurch forward and feel lighter, while moving down you feel the sudden weight and fall. 

# Traveling between planes
Certain locations on adjacent planes "overlap" more than others. In rare cases, the geography allows you to move between them without magic, but it is more violent. Enchanted locations ease the transition between planes, but these are rarer as you descend the planes and are usually guarded. A spell can help you move between planes, but the difficulty of casting varies by location. Overlapping nodes are easier, use a planar skill check to identify if the area you are in is a good location. A harder skill check indicates what direction to move to find a better overlap. Moving between planes in an arbitrary location is probably impossible.

# The Planes

From lowest to highest:

- Arkhe: dark, primal place. Ancient entropic forces predominate here, still  young due to the stillness of time and ghosts wander the surface. The ground is loose gravel constantly shifting under the heavy gravity and trapping those who walk. The sky is a red glowing pre-solar disk with other large celestial objects visible. This is the source of entropy and the turning of the nous, and emerging from here can put you at any point in time. 
- Naraka / Hell (hell/ghost realm, red/black): Volcanic and meteor activity constantly alert the rocky surface, but there is also an abundance of dense ores and minerals. Populated with banished demons and dragons and orc/goblin servants, who urgently machinate to return to the higher realms. They are painfully aware that time is passing without them. The sun is a hot white, shining through a thin atmosphere, and a cloud of asteroids surrounds the planet. (locations from Mars) 
- Maya/Aelfrice (fey animal realm, green): lush, elemental plane with many fey creatures. Low elves (halflings) dryad [plants], ? [water], gnome [earth], kobold [fire]. The sun is obscured and stars are not visible here, instead filtering through a yellow haze or blue if underwater. 
- Urth / Middleworld (human realm, blue): prime plane, mostly humans living simple lives.  
- Skai (titan realm, red/blue): High landscapes home to high elves, giants/titans, and dwarves. Large mountain ranges, valleys, and seas. Ancient kingdoms and enclaves, wuxi sorcery in the east. The moon is large and close. 
- Kleos/Heaven (deity realm, white): Fantastic cities and locales on the edge of the sky. Floating islands, seas of clouds. Ages past have left remnants of diverse ancient civilizations and beings. Some cultivate lore and craft, and use music to travel between planes. The sun is old and red and the moon has vanished, leaving a scattering of floating islands occasionally including a passing comets. (locations from the moon) 
- Elysia/Apeiron (void, white/black): accessible only from the orrery. Here the flat ground is made of course regolith, the cosmos stands visible above, and the horizon is only visible as a white glow. Very dangerous because moving any direction can quickly accelerate time forward or back and throw you into far dimensions and planes.

The upper planes are bigger than the lower planes, so that though you have twice as much time in a higher plane, you must travel twice as far to cover the same distance in a lower plane. Lower planes could provide "shortcuts", but could become time sinks if you tarry or are waylaid. The higher planes have slightly less gravity, and the lower planes slightly more, but this only starts to come into effect in the more distant planes and thus there are more flying creatures, floating vessels and cities, and clouds. 

Eschewing the cliche good and evil dichotomy, the higher planes tend instead to have lawful denizens of all alignments, while the lower planes have chaotic, shorter - lived creatures. The lower planes are extremely rich with natural resources, being constantly renewed by volcanic, tectonic, and meteoric activity. Many creatures and plants spring to life first here, and may spread to the upper planes. Creatures of the higher planes have eons of evolution that have lead to their longer lifespans and/or stable societies. That being said these "higher" beings are not necessarily more virtuous, and for those with the knowledge, the temptation is strong to exploit the resources of the lower planes or their peoples. Throughout history there are many tales of powerful beings who have tapped into great power beyond their plane, but often brought ruin or fall. The origin of many species and magical places was made this way. 

The planar alignment of any being can be told by their "spin". Spin 0 is prime plane, increases or decreases for higher or lower plane. It can also be seen in the eyes of a being's true form: +2 white, +1 blue, 0 normal, - 1 amber or red, - 2 black, 3 any

The Law of Symmetry describes the balance between the planes. Great acts on one plane can have an effect on the opposite spin planes. 

## Behind the planes
Why would the lower planes have more gravity, but be smaller? Partially because their smaller radius and higher mass, but also because of the presence of more dark matter and dark energy increases the warping of spacetime 

Why did Ober split the panes?

## The Elements

Elementals are quarks. Obey "Color confinement" theory: each element "color" has an "anticolor" and are held together by gluons. 

Color - Anticolor
Blue=water, Antiblue=metal (electricity) 
Red=fire, Antired=ice (cold)
Green=Earth, Antigreen=air (thunder) 
 Void, the binding force between elements = gluon, rounding out 7 elements



## Magic Items and Places
- Higgs Boson
- Numerists are the opponents of the geometers and their capital is Numenor. Newton created Fluxions and founded Numenor. 
- Newtonian gauge: measures time between planes 
- Gnomon

# Adventures
- Travel to the solar eclipse to observe planets near the sun, look for planet Vulcan

# House Rules
- Slower Rests: The maximum number of hit dice you can restore during a short rest is half your level (round up). Long rest also require you to spend hit dice to recover (up to your character level), and only one hit die is recovered per long rest.
- Exhausting Wounds: If you are dropped to zero hit points or if you still have less than half your hit points after a long rest, you get one point of exhaustion. 


# Time

## Calendar
Lunar calendar of 13 Months of 28 days plus a leap days, years designated by other planetary positions.  The (Zhou) calendar sets the beginning of the year at the day of the new moon before the winter solstice.

### Days of the Week
Sunday, Moonday, Towerday, Wineday, Thunderday, Fireday, Starday
