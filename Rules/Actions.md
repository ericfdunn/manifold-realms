## Action Points

When you roll initiative, you get 1 action point (if you were not surprised).

At the end of your turn, you lose any remaining actions and gain 3 action points. Most common things take one action, but repeating the same thing twice in a turn costs an extra action.

When it's not your turn, you can spend one action point to take a reaction. Action points spent this way are no longer available on your turn. So, you will always get three total action points to take in a round, either on your turn or between them.

## Actions in Combat

### Attack

The most common action to take in combat is the Attack action, whether you are swinging a sword, firing an arrow from a bow, or brawling with your fists. with this action, you make one melee or ranged attack. 

#### Grapple
When you want to grab a creature or wrestle with it, you can use the Attack action to make a special melee attack, a grapple. If you’re able to make multiple attacks with the Attack action, this attack replaces one of them.

The target of your grapple must be no more than one size larger than you and must be within your reach. Using at least one free hand, you try to seize the target by making a grapple check instead of an attack roll: a Strength (Athletics) check contested by the target’s Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check (the target chooses the ability to use). If you succeed, you subject the target to the grappled condition (see Conditions ). The condition specifies the things that end it, and you can release the target whenever you like (no action required).

**Escaping a Grapple:** A grappled creature can use its action to escape. To do so, it must succeed on a Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check contested by your Strength (Athletics) check.

**Moving a Grappled Creature:** When you move, you can drag or carry the grappled creature with you, but your speed is halved, unless the creature is two or more sizes smaller than you.

#### Shove
Using the Attack action, you can make a special melee attack to shove a creature, either to knock it prone or push it away from you. If you’re able to make multiple attacks with the Attack action, this attack replaces one of them.
The target must be no more than one size larger than you and must be within your reach. Instead of making an attack roll, you make a Strength (Athletics) check contested by the target’s Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check (the target chooses the ability to use). If you win the contest, you either knock the target prone or push it 5 feet away from you.

### Cast a Spell

Each spell has a casting time, which specifies how many action points, minutes, or even hours to cast the spell and whether it can be cast between turn as a reaction. If you have enough action points to finish casting a spell during your turn, the spell takes effect immediately. If you start casting a spell but do not have enough action points to finish it on your turn, you must hold concentration on the spell and can try to complete it at the start of your next turn by spending the remaining action points needed. For spells that have a casting time of minutes or longer, you must spend all of your actions on your turn casting that spell until the casting is complete. If your concentration is ever broken or you take some other action before finishing the casting, the spell dissipates without taking effect.

### Disengage

If you take the Disengage action, your movement doesn’t provoke opportunity attacks for the rest of the turn.

### Dodge

When you take the Dodge action, you focus entirely on avoiding attacks. Until the start of your next turn, if you can see the attacker any attack roll they make against you has disadvantage, and you make Dexterity saving throws with advantage. You lose this benefit if you attack, cast a spell, are **incapacitated,** or if your speed drops to 0.

### Help

You can lend your aid to another in the completion of a task. You can take the Help action during any ally's turn, spending one action point to grant them advantage on the next ability check they make to perform the task you are helping with, provided that the check takes place before your next action. Alternatively, you can aid a friendly creature in attacking a creature within 5 feet of you. You feint, distract the target, or in some other way team up to make your ally’s attack more effective. If your ally attacks the target before your next action, the first attack roll is made with advantage.

### Hide

When you take the Hide action, you make a Dexterity (Stealth) check in an attempt to hide, following the rules for hiding. If you succeed, you gain certain benefits, as described in the **Unseen Attackers and Targets** section.

### Move

When you take the move action, you may move up to your speed.

### Ready

You can spend one action point on your turn to ready an action to use between turns that would normally not qualify for a reaction. First, you decide what perceivable circumstance will trigger your reaction. Then, you choose the action you will take in response to that trigger, it must be a free action or cost one action point. Examples include “If the cultist steps on the trapdoor, I’ll pull the lever that opens it,” and “If the goblin steps next to me, I move away.” When the trigger occurs, you can either take your readied right after the trigger finishes or ignore the trigger. Taking your readied action costs an action point as normal. When you ready a spell, you cast it as normal but hold its energy, which you release with your reaction when the trigger occurs. To be readied, a spell must have a casting time of 2 action points or less, and holding onto the spell’s magic requires concentration. If your concentration is broken, the spell dissipates without taking effect. For example, if you are concentrating on the _**web**_ spell and ready _**magic missile**_, your _**web**_ spell ends, and if you take damage before you release magic missile with your reaction, your concentration might be broken.

### Search

When you take the Search action, you devote your attention to finding something. Depending on the nature of your search, the GM might have you make a Wisdom (Perception) check or an Intelligence (Investigation) check.

### Study

When you take the Study Action, you make an Intelligence Check to study your memory, a book, a creature, a clue, an object, or another source of knowledge and call to mind an important piece of information about it. The Areas of Knowledge table in [[Abilities & Skills]] suggests which Skills are applicable when you take this Action, depending on the area of knowledge the Intelligence Check is about.

### Use an Object

You normally interact with an object while doing something else, such as when you draw a sword as part of an attack. When an object requires your action for its use, you take the Use an Object action. This action is also useful when you want to interact with more than one object on your turn.

## Free Actions
- You can communicate however you are able, through brief utterances and gestures, as you take your turn.  
- You can also interact with one object or feature of the environment for free, during either your move or your action. For example, you could open a door during your move as you stride toward a foe, or you could draw your weapon as part of the same action you use to attack.  
- If you want to interact with a second object, you need to use your action. Some magic items and other special objects always require an action to use, as stated in their descriptions.  
- The GM might require you to use an action for any of these activities when it needs special care or when it presents an unusual obstacle. For instance, the GM could reasonably expect you to use an action to open a stuck door or turn a crank to lower a drawbridge.
