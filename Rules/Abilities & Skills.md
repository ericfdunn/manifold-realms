Every task that a character or monster might attempt in the game is covered by one of the six abilities. This section explains in more detail what those abilities mean and the ways they are used in the game.

# Abilities

### Strength

Strength measures bodily power, athletic training, and the extent to which you can exert raw physical force. A Strength check can model any attempt to lift, push, pull, or break something, to force your body through a space, or to otherwise apply brute force to a situation. 

The GM might call for a Strength check when you try to accomplish tasks like the following:

-   Force open a stuck, locked, or barred door
-   Break free of bonds
-   Push through a tunnel that is too small
-   Hang on to a wagon while being dragged behind it
-   Tip over a statue
-   Keep a boulder from rolling

##### Attack Rolls and Damage

You add your Strength modifier to your attack roll and your damage roll when attacking with a melee weapon such as a mace, a battleaxe, or a javelin. You use melee weapons to make melee attacks in hand-to-hand combat, and some of them can be thrown to make a ranged attack.

> [!TIP] Lifting and Carrying
> 
> Your Strength score determines the amount of weight you can bear. The following terms define what you can lift or carry.
> 
> _**Carrying Capacity.**_ Your carrying capacity is your Strength score multiplied by 15. This is the weight (in pounds) that you can carry, which is high enough that most characters don’t usually have to worry about it.
> 
> _**Push, Drag, or Lift.**_ You can push, drag, or lift a weight in pounds up to twice your carrying capacity (or 30 times your Strength score). While pushing or dragging weight in excess of your carrying capacity, your speed drops to 5 feet.
> 
> _**Size and Strength.**_ Larger creatures can bear more weight, whereas Tiny creatures can carry less. For each size category above Medium, double the creature’s carrying capacity and the amount it can push, drag, or lift. For a Tiny creature, halve these weights.
> 
> ***Variant: Encumbrance*** If you carry weight in excess of 5 times your Strength score, you are **encumbered**, which means your speed drops by 10 feet.  If you carry weight in excess of 10 times your Strength score, up to your maximum carrying capacity, you are instead **heavily encumbered**, which means your speed drops by 20 feet and you have disadvantage on ability checks, attack rolls, and saving throws that use Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution.

### Dexterity

Dexterity measures agility, reflexes, and balance. A Dexterity check can model any attempt to move nimbly, quickly, or quietly, or to keep from falling on tricky footing.

The GM might call for a Dexterity check when you try to accomplish tasks like the following:

-   Control a heavily laden cart on a steep descent
-   Steer a chariot around a tight turn
-   Pick a lock
-   Disable a trap
-   Securely tie up a prisoner
-   Wriggle free of bonds
-   Play a stringed instrument
-   Craft a small or detailed object

### Constitution

Constitution measures health, stamina, and vital force. Constitution checks are uncommon, and no skills apply to Constitution checks, because the endurance this ability represents is largely passive rather than involving a specific effort on the part of a character or monster. A Constitution check can model your attempt to push beyond normal limits, however.

The GM might call for a Constitution check when you try to accomplish tasks like the following:

-   Hold your breath
-   March or labor for hours without rest
-   Go without sleep
-   Survive without food or water
-   Quaff an entire stein of ale in one go


### Intelligence

Intelligence measures mental acuity, accuracy of recall, and the ability to reason. An Intelligence check is called for when you need to draw on logic, education, memory, or deductive reasoning. 

The GM might call for an Intelligence check when you try to accomplish tasks like the following:

-   Communicate with a creature without using words
-   Estimate the value of a precious item
-   Pull together a disguise to pass as a city guard
-   Forge a document
-   Recall lore about a craft or trade
-   Win a game of skill

> [!TIP] Areas of Knowledge
>  - Arcana:  Spells, magic items, eldritch symbols, magical traditions, planes of existence, and certain creatures (Aberrations, Constructs, Elementals, Fey, and Monstrosities)
>  - Culture: Historic events and people, ancient civilizations, wars, religions, symbols, and certain creatures (Giants and Humanoids)
>  - Investigation: Traps, ciphers, riddles, and gadgetry
>  - Nature: Terrain, flora, weather, and certain creatures (Beasts, Oozes, and Plants)   
>  - Cosmology:  Properties and places of the planes, planar travel, and certain creatures (Dragons, Celestials, and Fiends)


### Wisdom

Wisdom reflects how attuned you are to the world around you and represents perceptiveness and intuition. A Wisdom check might reflect an effort to read body language, understand someone’s feelings, notice things about the environment, or care for an injured person.

The GM might call for a Wisdom check when you try to accomplish tasks like the following:

-   Get a gut feeling about what course of action to follow
-   Discern whether a seemingly dead or living creature is undead

### Charisma

Charisma measures your ability to interact effectively with others. It includes such factors as confidence and eloquence, and it can represent a charming or commanding personality. A Charisma check might arise when you try to influence or entertain others, when you try to make an impression or tell a convincing lie, or when you are navigating a tricky social situation. 

The GM might call for a Charisma check when you try to accomplish tasks like the following:

-   Find the best person to talk to for news, rumors, and gossip
-   Blend into a crowd to get the sense of key topics of conversation

# Skills

A skill is a special type of ability check that can benefit from training or practice. If you have the right tools and tool proficiency, you gain advantage on your skill check.

### Animal Handling
Your #Wisdom (AnimalHandling) check covers when you try to calm down a domesticated animal, keep a mount from getting spooked, or intuit an animal’s intentions. 

Given enough time, you can also teach an animal a trick or train for a purpose:

| DC  | Example Task                                                           |
| --- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 10  | Perform a known trick                                                  |
| 15  | Teach to come, stay, or fetch. Train to ride or work.                  |
| 20  | Teach to attack, defend, or track. Train for hunting or combat riding. |

You make a #Dexterity (Animal Handling) check to control your mount when you attempt a risky maneuver.

| DC  | Task                              |
| --- | --------------------------------- |
| 5   | Avoid falling from a saddle       |
| 10  | Direct your mount to jump or dash |
| 15  | Dismount as a bonus action or recover from a fall       |
| 20  | Control an untrained mount in battle                                  |

A #Charisma (Animal Handling) check may be used to befriend or influence an intelligent beast.

### Acrobatics 
Your #Dexterity (Acrobatics) check covers your attempt to stay on your feet in a tricky situation, such as when you’re trying to run across a sheet of ice, balance on a tightrope, or stay upright on a rocking ship’s deck. The GM might also call for a Dexterity (Acrobatics) check to see if you can perform acrobatic stunts, including dives, rolls, somersaults, and flips.

| DC  | Balance                                   | Tumble                     |
| --- | ----------------------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| 10  | Run on an uneven floor                    |                            |
| 12  | Walk on a slippery surface                |                            |
| 15  | Walk on a narrow or very slippery surface | Move without provoking AoO |
| 20  | Walk on a surface less than 2 inches wide | Move through opponent's space                           |

A #Constitution (Acrobatics) check may be called for if you have to balance or tumble over a long distance.

### Athletics
Your #Strength (Athletics) check covers difficult situations you encounter while climbing, jumping, or swimming. Examples include the following activities:

-   You attempt to climb a sheer or slippery cliff, avoid hazards while scaling a wall, or cling to a surface while something is trying to knock you off.
-   You try to jump an unusually long distance or pull off a stunt midjump.
-   You struggle to swim or stay afloat in treacherous currents, storm‑tossed waves, or areas of thick seaweed. Or another creature tries to push or pull you underwater or otherwise interfere with your swimming.

#### Climbing, Swimming, and Crawling

While climbing or swimming, each foot of movement costs 1 extra foot (2 extra feet in difficult terrain), unless a creature has a climbing or swimming speed. At the GM’s option, climbing a slippery vertical surface or one with few handholds requires a successful Strength (Athletics) check. Similarly, gaining any distance in rough water might require a successful Strength (Athletics) check.  

#### Jumping

Your Strength determines how far you can jump.  
  
**Long Jump**. When you make a long jump, you cover a number of feet up to your Strength score if you move at least 10 feet on foot immediately before the jump. When you make a standing long jump, you can leap only half that distance. Either way, each foot you clear on the jump costs a foot of movement.  
  
This rule assumes that the height of your jump doesn’t matter, such as a jump across a stream or chasm. At your GM’s option, you must succeed on a DC 10 Strength (Athletics) check to clear a low obstacle (no taller than a quarter of the jump’s distance), such as a hedge or low wall. Otherwise, you hit it.  
  
When you land in difficult terrain, you must succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity (Acrobatics) check to land on your feet. Otherwise, you land prone.  
  
**High Jump**. When you make a high jump, you leap into the air a number of feet equal to 3 + your Strength modifier if you move at least 10 feet on foot immediately before the jump. When you make a standing high jump, you can jump only half that distance. Either way, each foot you clear on the jump costs a foot of movement. In some circumstances, your GM might allow you to make a Strength (Athletics) check to jump higher than you normally can.  
  
You can extend your arms half your height above yourself during the jump. Thus, you can reach above you a distance equal to the height of the jump plus 1½ times your height.

| DC  | Climb                                          | Jump | Swim         |
| --- | ---------------------------------------------- | ---- | ------------ |
|  5  | Knotted rope or rope with wall to brace          |  5 feet long or 2 feet high    | Still Water   |
| 10  | A surface with ledges or ship's rigging          |  10 feet long or 3 feet high    | Calm Water   |
| 15  | Hand and foot holds, a tree, or unknotted rope |  15 feet long or 4 feet high    | Rought Water |
| 20  | Rough rock with narrow holds                   |  20 feet long or 5 feet high    | Stormy Water |
| 25    | Natural rock or brick wall, or overhang      |  25 feet long or 6 feet high    | Rapids             |

A #Constitution (Athletics) check may be called for in situations where you have to climb, swim, or run over a long distance.

### Arcana
Your #Intelligence (Arcana) check measures your ability to recall lore about spells, magic items, eldritch symbols, magical traditions, the planes of existence, and the inhabitants of those planes.  

- Identify a spell being cast DC 10 + spell level
- Identify a spell being cast without visible components DC 20

If you are proficient in Arcana, you may detect the presence of a magic aura at close range with a DC 15 #Wisdom (Arcana) check.

## Cosmology
Your #Intelligence (Arcana) check measures your ability to recall lore about the outer planes, travel between planes, and the history of the outer planes and their civilizations.

If you are proficient in Cosmology, you may detect the presence of portal at close range with a DC 15 #Wisdom (Cosmology) check.

### Culture
Your #Intelligence (Culture) check measures your ability to recall lore about historical events, famous people, legends, beliefs, past disputes, recent wars, and ancient kingdoms.

A #Wisdom (Culture) check may be used to deduce the norms and taboos of a social group.

A #Charisma (Culture) check may be called for if you need to perform a ceremony or observe complex etiquette.

### Deception
Your #Charisma (Deception) check determines whether you can convincingly hide the truth, either verbally or through your actions. This deception can encompass everything from misleading others through ambiguity to telling outright lies. Typical situations include trying to fast-­‐‑ talk a guard, con a merchant, earn money through gambling, pass yourself off in a disguise, dull someone’s suspicions with false assurances, or maintain a straight face while telling a blatant lie. 

An #Intelligence (Deception) check may be used to improvise a disguise or forged documents.

?? Remove 
A #Strength or #Dexterity (Deception) check could be made in melee combat to feint an opponent, granting advantage on the next attack on that opponent before the start of their turn. This is an attack action and the DC is your opponent's AC.

### Insight
Your Wisdom ( #Insight) check decides whether you can determine the true intentions of a creature, such as when searching out a lie or predicting someone’s next move. Doing so involves gleaning clues from body language, speech habits, and changes in mannerisms.

- A DC 20 Insight check would notice that someone is under the effect of an enchantment

### Intimidation
When you attempt to influence someone through overt threats, hostile actions, and physical violence, the GM might ask you to make a #Charisma (Intimidation) check. Examples include trying to pry information out of a prisoner, convincing street thugs to back down from a confrontation, or using the edge of a broken bottle to convince a sneering vizier to reconsider a decision.

A #Strength (Intimidation) check may be used instead if if you have apparent physical power or size over the target.

### Investigation
When you look around for clues and make deductions based on those clues, you make an #Intelligence (Investigation) check. You might deduce the location of a hidden object, discern from the appearance of a wound what kind of weapon dealt it, or determine the weakest point in a tunnel that could cause it to collapse. Poring through ancient scrolls in search of a hidden fragment of knowledge might also call for an Intelligence (Investigation) check.

A #Charisma (Investigation) check can be used to gather information in a social setting about news, rumors, or pieces of lore.


### Medicine
A Wisdom ( #Medicine) check lets you try to stabilize a dying companion (DC 15) or diagnose an illness. With a healer's kit, you can attempt more tasks:

| DC         | Task                                     |
| ---------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| 15         | Stabilize dying creature                 |
| 15         | Remove movement penalty caused by injury |
| Poison DC  | Remove poison                            |
| Disease DC | Remove disease                                         |

##### Long-Term Care
If you are proficient in Medicine, you can aid in the healing of a number of creatures equal to your proficiency bonus. During a long or short rest, creatures that you are tending recover the maximum number of hit points for each hit die they spend. While you are tending others, you do not gain the benefits of the rest. 

### Nature
Your #Intelligence (Nature) check measures your ability to recall lore about terrain, plants and animals, the weather, and natural cycles.

A #Wisdom (Nature) check may be used to notice something unusual in your natural suroundings.

### Perception
Your Wisdom ( #Perception) check lets you spot, hear, or otherwise detect the presence of something. It measures your general awareness of your surroundings and the keenness of your senses. For example, you might try to hear a conversation through a closed door, eavesdrop under an open window, or hear monsters moving stealthily in the forest. Or you might try to spot things that are obscured or easy to miss, whether they are orcs lying in ambush on a road, thugs hiding in the shadows of an alley, or candlelight under a closed secret door.
  
**_What Can You See?_** One of the main factors in determining whether you can find a hidden creature or object is how well you can see in an area, which might be **lightly** or **heavily**  
**obscured**, as explained in "The Environment."

> [!TIP] Passive Perception
> 
> When you hide, there's a chance someone will notice you even if they aren't searching. To determine whether such a creature notices you, the GM compares your  
> Dexterity (Stealth) check with that creature's passive Wisdom (Perception) score, which equals 10 + the creature's Wisdom modifier, as well as any other bonuses or penalties. If the creature has advantage, add 5. For disadvantage, subtract 5. For example, if a 1st-level character (with a proficiency bonus of +2) has a Wisdom of 15 (a +2 modifier) and proficiency in Perception, he or she has a passive Wisdom (Perception) of 14.  

### Performance
Your #Charisma (Performance) check determines how well you can delight an audience with music, dance, acting, storytelling, or some other form of entertainment.

A #Strength or #Dexterity (Performance) check may be called for if your performance focuses on feats of strength or acrobatics.

### Persuasion
When you attempt to influence someone or a group of people with tact, social graces, or good nature, the GM might ask you to make a Charisma ( #Persuasion) check. Typically, you use persuasion when acting in good faith, to foster friendships, make cordial requests, or exhibit proper etiquette. Examples of persuading others include convincing a chamberlain to let your party see the king, negotiating peace between warring tribes, or inspiring a crowd of townsfolk.

An #Intelligence (Persuasion) check can be used to make an argument based on logic.

### Sleight of Hand
Whenever you attempt an act of legerdemain or manual trickery, such as planting something on someone else or concealing an object on your person, make a #Dexterity ( SleightofHand) check. The GM might also call for a Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check to determine whether you can lift a coin purse off another person or slip something out of another person’s pocket.

An #Intelligence (Sleight of Hand) check may be substituted for tying a rope or bonds.

### Stealth
Make a #Dexterity (Stealth) check when you attempt to conceal yourself from enemies, slink past guards, slip away without being noticed, or sneak up on someone without being seen or heard.

> [!TIP] **Hiding**  
>   
> The GM decides when circumstances are appropriate for hiding. When you try to hide, make a Dexterity (Stealth) check. Until you are discovered or you stop hiding, that check's total is  contested by the Wisdom (Perception) check of any creature that actively searches for signs of your presence.  
>   
> You can't hide from a creature that can see you clearly, and you give away your position if you make noise, such as shouting a warning or  knocking over a vase.  
>   
> An invisible creature can always try to hide. Signs of its passage might still be noticed, and it does have to stay quiet.  
>   
> In combat, most creatures stay alert for signs of danger all around, so if you come out of hiding and approach a creature, it usually sees you. However, under certain circumstances, the GM might allow you to stay hidden as you approach a creature that is distracted, allowing you to gain advantage on an attack roll before you are seen.  

A #Charisma (Stealth) check may be called for if you are attempting to be unnoticed or hide in a crowd by blending in.

An #Intelligence (Stealth) check can be used to find a hiding spot or create a camouflage.

### Survival
The GM might ask you to make a Wisdom ( #Survival) check to follow tracks, hunt wild game, guide your group through frozen wastelands, identify signs that owlbears live nearby, predict the weather, or avoid quicksand and other natural hazards.

**Tracking DCs**

| Ground Surface | DC |
|-----------------|-----|
| Soft Surface / Snow | 10 |
| Dirt or Grass | 15 |
| Bare Stone    | 20 |
| Each day since the creature passed | +5 |
| Creature left a trail such as blood     | -5  |

An #Intelligence (Survival) check may be called for to establish your position using triangulation or a map. #Intelligence (Survival) can also be used to identify edible forage, dangerous plants and animals, and remains.
