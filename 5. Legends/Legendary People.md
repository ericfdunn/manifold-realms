Since this setting is set far into the future, the pantheon of "deities" are the greatest mathematicians, astronomers, artists, and philosophers. The most important discoveries were special relativity, the motions of planets & celestial objects, geometry, the theory of music, and the mathematical descriptions of life like chaos theory and fractals.


## Famous Spellcasters

Ober Allsteen - (Einstein) the most powerful wizard, cleaved the planes from each other and set them in motion (the "annus mirabilis"). Before him, it was thought that the world floated in the Aether, a mysterious gas that contributed to all properties of matter. He knew there was more to the cosmos than that, and created a ritual so powerful that it would sunder the Aether and elevate civilization towards peace and stability on a higher plane. This also had the effect of separating the Apeiron and the Arche. However, nature being more diverse than what he imagined, differing aspects of humanity were sundered across the planes at this time. After seeing the strife this caused, he encouraged the people he called Zion to prepare for war. This lead to a conflict lasting a millennia which he would come to regret. 

Paracelsus - once a healer, delved into transmutation and created the gnomes 

Plank 

Ling Lun - founder of music theory 

Ptolemy - a Roman mathematician, astronomer, astrologer, geographer, and music theorist

Safi al-Din al-Urmawi al-Baghdadi (Persian: صفی الدین اورموی) or Safi al-Din Abd al-Mu'min ibn Yusuf ibn al-Fakhir al-Urmawi al-Baghdadi (born c. 1216 AD in Urmia, died in 1294 AD in Baghdad) was a renowned musician and writer on the theory of music.

Stephen Hawkins - studied too long the dark maw beneath the lowest realm, turned into a mad dire owl


Orpheus - Ancient bard, journeyed into hell and the experience led to the development of the church of Orphism, whose chief belief is that life exists as a contact between body and soul which dissolves at death. The soul would eventually be rebound by a new body, but the ultimate goal was liberation of the soul. Experiments with life extension lead to the creation of necromantic magic. At first, the contract could be extended, but later creations of animated dead lead to the justification that the soul no longer holds claim to the flesh. 

Nilibohr (Bohr) - Patron of wizards

Lorens (Lorentz) - great geometer that built the first waypoints for planar travel. 

Rikkar Findman (Feynman) - sorcerer/bard? Symbol of Rikkar Findman is a pendant wrapped in wire and feathers that form a spikey diagram. The symbol might be carved into stone waymarkers or wooden signs along roads and trails to guide travelers on their journeys.

Pythagoras - first Geometer, traveled the world to learn from the wisest in each land before codifying the secret Symbola. He started a school at Kroton (Now in Skai) and there founded the church of Pythagorianism, whose adherents believed in communal lifestyle and study of music along with the arcane. He also espoused the philosophy of the transmigration of souls from one body to another. 

(Poincaré) - mapped the planes and famous for harnessing the chaotic power of the lower planes. Left a great geometric riddle (the Poincaré conjecture) 

Mandelbrot - chaoticist, first powerful wizard of the nether

Nyx - ancient sorcerer of the shadow plane 

Anaxagoras - set the earth spinning (nous= the turning of the planes), Anaxagoras described the world as a mixture of primary imperishable ingredients, where material variation was never caused by an absolute presence of a particular ingredient, but rather by its relative preponderance over the other ingredients

Paracelsus - once a healer, delved into transmutation and created the gnomes

Hypatia of Alexandria (Geometer) was a Greek philosopher, astronomer, and mathematician. She was the salaried head of the Neoplatonic School in Alexandria, Egypt, from the year 400. She probably wrote on mathematics, astronomy, and philosophy, including about the motions of the planets, about number theory and about conic sections. It is surmised by some that she invented the plane astrolabe, the graduated brass hydrometer, and the hydroscope, with Synesius of Greece, who was her student and later colleague. The evidence may also point to simply being able to construct those instruments. Hypatia is said to have dressed in the clothing of a scholar or teacher, rather than in women's clothing. She moved about freely, driving her own chariot, contrary to the norm for women's public behavior. She was credited by the surviving sources as having political influence in the city, especially with Orestes, the Roman governor of Alexandria.

Sophie Germain studied geometry to escape boredom during the French Revolution], when she was confined to her family's home, and went on to do important work in mathematics, especially her work on Fermat's Last Theorem.

Elena Cornaro Piscopia was an Italian mathematician and theologian. She was a child prodigy who studied many languages, composed music, sang and played many instruments, and learned philosophy, mathematics, and theology. Her doctorate, a first, was from the University of Padua, where she studied theology. She became a lecturer there in mathematics.

Eratosthenes of Cyrene (Numerist) was an ancient Greek mathematician, poet, and astronomer who is known as the father of geography. Eratosthenes was the first person to use the word "geography" and other geographical terms that are still in use today, and his efforts to calculate the circumference of the Earth and the distance from the Earth to the Sun paved the way for our modern understanding of the cosmos. Among his other many accomplishments were the creation of the first map of the world and the invention of an algorithm known as the sieve of Eratosthenes, which is used to identify prime numbers. After hearing about a deep well at Syene (near the Tropic of Cancer and modern-day Aswan) where sunlight only struck the bottom of the well on the summer solstice, Eratosthenes worked out a method by which he could calculate the circumference of the Earth using basic geometry.

**Astronubis**: A blend of "Astron," deriving from the Greek word for star, and "Anubis," the Egyptian god of mummification and the afterlife, often associated with the stars. This name reflects a connection between the stars and the eternal cycle of life and death.

Hesiod - God of the lowest realm, Arkhe

Azathoth - chaotic being of the lower realms

Anaximander - In [astronomy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomy "Astronomy"), he attempted to describe the mechanics of celestial bodies in relation to the Earth. In physics, his postulation that the indefinite (or [apeiron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apeiron_(cosmology) "Apeiron (cosmology)")) was the source of all things led Greek philosophy to a new level of conceptual [abstraction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstraction "Abstraction"). His knowledge of [geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometry "Geometry") allowed him to introduce the [gnomon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gnomon "Gnomon") in Greece. He created a [map of the world](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_map "World map") that contributed greatly to the advancement of [geography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geography "Geography").
