## Immat
Immat was smuggled into middleworld through the Wizard's gate with the help of Severin, tricked by Yuri. When he discovered what he had done he attempted to the dragon, but Yuri had stolen the magical sword she helped him craft. Using his dagger, the only place he could pierce Setr's hide was his eyes, which he slashed and blinded the wyrmling. If Immat has time, he will grow into a larger a dragon, a process that is sped by the consumption of flesh from the valence of middleworld. Already he has fed on the beasts of the forests near Windy Valley and is stronger than a normal Wyrmling.
