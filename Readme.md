# The Manifold Realms

The Manifold Realms is a fantasy RPG setting inspired by fantasy and scifi literature, but steps away from fantasy tropes of religion and magic to instead substitute mechanics drawn from science and history (with a healthy dose of creative license). Most fantasy stories can find a place in Manifold since each plane presents unique flavors and opportunities. However, the interactions between the planes and the novel magic system will add new twists to the old cliches!
