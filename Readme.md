# The Manifold Realms

The Manifold Realms is a fantasy RPG setting inspired by, but not a simulation of, real-world sciences and mathematics. Ideas from general relativity, particle physics, and cosmology are featured in the rules and lore. The presence of magic warps spacetime, which shapes the planes and gives spells new flavor and interesting side effects. Most fantasy stories can find a place in the Manifold Realms since each plane presents unique flavors and opportunities, but the interactions between the planes and magic will add new twists!

Game rules assume a basis in D&D 5e for the d20 system and overall scaling, but many optional rules and spell definitions are suggested here.
