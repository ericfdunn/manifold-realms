## The Aelph
Created in the image of the elves, they are divided into groups orginial based on their elemental alignment. Although each type of Aelph has their own motivations and allegiences, they all have the ability to shapechange and shadow walk on the material plane, but have light sensitivity to the sun on the prime plane (and above) and amber eyes.
